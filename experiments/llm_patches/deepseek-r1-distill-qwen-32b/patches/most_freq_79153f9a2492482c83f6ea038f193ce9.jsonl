Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select to create a selector where tokens are equal, then uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. That should give the frequency of each token. The example shows it returns [2,1,2,1] for \"abac\", which makes sense. So make_hist() seems correct.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a selector where keys are less than each other, then uses SelectorWidth to get target positions. Then it selects where target_pos equals the indices and aggregates the vals. Wait, but SelectorWidth returns the count of Trues per row, which for the LT selector would be the number of elements less than the current key. So target_pos would be the rank of each element. Then sel_new is selecting where the rank equals the index. But indices start at 0, and ranks start at 0 as well. So for the first element, target_pos is 0, which matches index 0. For the second, target_pos is 1, which matches index 1, etc. That should correctly reorder the vals. But I'm not sure if this handles duplicates correctly since the example in make_sort() shows it works when keys are unique. So make_sort_unique() might be okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It adjusts the keys by adding a small value based on indices to make them unique, then calls make_sort_unique(). The adjustment is done using SequenceMap, adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. This should ensure that even if two keys are the same, their adjusted keys are unique because of the index-based addition. That makes sense. So make_sort() seems correct.\n\nFinally, make_sort_freq(). It's supposed to sort tokens by their frequency, with ties broken by their original order. The current code computes hist as -0 * make_hist(), which is just zero. That's incorrect because hist should be the frequency of each token. So the keys for sorting are based on hist, but hist is zero, which means all keys are the same. Then, when make_sort() is called, it adjusts the keys using max_seq_len and min_key, but since hist is zero, the adjusted keys are all the same plus a tiny index-based value. This would sort the tokens based on their original positions, but the frequencies aren't being used correctly.\n\nWait, the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") is problematic. It's creating a sequence where each element is 0, because -0 * anything is 0. That's not right. Instead, hist should be the output of make_hist(), which gives the frequency counts. So the correct line should be hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\"). \n\nAlso, the function signature for make_sort_freq is given as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function expects more arguments. Wait, looking back, the original code has make_sort_freq defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter, but in the example, it's called with three arguments. That's a discrepancy. So the function should probably take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort(). \n\nWait, looking at the original code:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = - 0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, the example shows make_sort_freq is called with three arguments: rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5. But the function definition only takes max_seq_len. That's a problem. So the function should be modified to accept vals and keys as parameters, similar to make_sort(). \n\nSo the correct function signature should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which matches this signature.\n\nSo the first issue is that make_sort_freq is missing the vals and keys parameters. \n\nAdditionally, the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") is incorrect. It should be hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\"). Because make_hist() returns the frequency counts, which are the counts of each token. \n\nWait, but make_hist() returns an SOp that, when evaluated, gives the frequency of each token. So in make_sort_freq(), we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency. So the keys for sorting should be the negative frequencies (since we want higher frequencies to come first). Or perhaps the frequencies themselves, but in a way that higher frequencies result in lower keys, so they come first when sorted in ascending order.\n\nWait, in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1], and the output is [2,2,4,1]. The frequencies are: 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorted order is [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency descending, and for ties (4 and 1), they retain their original order.\n\nSo to achieve this, the keys should be based on frequency, but in a way that higher frequencies come first. So the keys for sorting should be the negative frequencies, so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies (more negative) come first.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the frequency as the key and sort in descending order, but the current make_sort() function sorts in ascending order. So to sort by frequency descending, we can use the negative frequencies as the keys.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the keys should be the negative of the histogram values. \n\nWait, but in the current code, hist is set to -0 * make_hist(), which is zero. That's wrong. It should be hist = make_hist(), and then perhaps negated.\n\nWait, let me think again. The make_sort() function sorts the vals based on the keys in ascending order. So if we want to sort by frequency descending, we can use the negative frequencies as the keys. So the keys would be -hist.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the keys should be -hist. \n\nBut in the current code, hist is set to -0 * make_hist(), which is zero. That's incorrect. It should be hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\"), and then keys = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\").\n\nWait, but in the code, the keys are passed as hist. So perhaps the code should be:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nkeys = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\nreturn make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut looking back, the original code has:\n\nhist = - 0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nSo the hist is zero, which is wrong. It should be the actual frequencies. Also, the function is missing the vals and keys parameters.\n\nSo to fix make_sort_freq(), I need to:\n\n1. Correct the function signature to accept vals and keys.\n2. Compute the histogram correctly.\n3. Use the negative histogram values as keys for sorting so that higher frequencies come first.\n4. Pass these keys to make_sort().\n\nAdditionally, in the example usage, the function is called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that vals and keys are both rasp.tokens, and max_seq_len is 5.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_sort_freq() should:\n\n- Take vals, keys, and max_seq_len as parameters.\n- Compute the histogram of the tokens.\n- Negate the histogram to sort in descending order of frequency.\n- Call make_sort() with vals, the negated histogram as keys, max_seq_len, and min_key=1.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the keys passed to make_sort() are hist, which was zero. So the correct approach is to compute hist as the frequency, then negate it for sorting.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort_freq() would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the keys parameter in make_sort_freq() was rasp.tokens, but in the function, we're using hist as the keys. So perhaps the function should compute the hist based on the keys parameter.\n\nWait, no. The keys parameter in make_sort_freq() is the same as the vals, because we're sorting the tokens based on their frequency. So perhaps the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")  # hist is based on rasp.tokens\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, make_hist() uses rasp.tokens, which is the input sequence. So if the keys are different, perhaps we should compute the hist based on the keys. But in the example, keys are rasp.tokens, so it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should compute the hist based on the keys parameter. So if keys are different, it uses those. But in the example, keys are the same as vals.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function should compute the hist based on the keys. So the line should be:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")  # but make_hist() uses rasp.tokens, which may not be the same as keys.\n\nWait, no. make_hist() is defined as returning the frequency of each token in the input sequence. So if the keys are different, perhaps we need to compute the hist based on the keys. But in the current setup, make_hist() uses rasp.tokens, which is the input sequence. So if the keys are a different sequence, this would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should compute the frequency of each element in the keys sequence. So instead of using make_hist(), which uses rasp.tokens, we should create a hist based on the keys.\n\nBut make_hist() is a function that returns an SOp which, when evaluated, gives the frequency of each token in the input sequence. So if we want to compute the frequency of the keys, we need to pass the keys to make_hist(). But make_hist() doesn't take any parameters; it always uses rasp.tokens.\n\nWait, looking back, make_hist() is defined as:\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nSo it's based on rasp.tokens. So if the keys are a different sequence, this would not compute the correct frequencies. But in the context of make_sort_freq(), the keys are the same as the tokens, because we're sorting the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nSo perhaps the function is correct as is, but the issue is that hist is being set to zero. So the main fix is to correct that line.\n\nAdditionally, the function signature is incorrect because it's missing the vals and keys parameters.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_sort_freq() function should:\n\n- Accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len as parameters.\n- Compute the histogram of the tokens (which is the same as the keys in this context).\n- Negate the histogram to sort in descending order of frequency.\n- Call make_sort() with vals, the negated histogram, max_seq_len, and min_key=1.\n\nSo the corrected code would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the keys passed to make_sort() were hist, which was zero. So by changing hist to the actual frequency and negating it, the sorting should work correctly.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are adjusted by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that even if two keys are the same, their adjusted keys are unique based on their position. This is necessary for breaking ties in the sorting.\n\nSo with these changes, make_sort_freq() should correctly sort the tokens by their frequency, with ties broken by their original order.\n\nSo the main issues were:\n\n1. make_sort_freq() was missing the vals and keys parameters in its function signature.\n2. The hist variable was incorrectly set to zero instead of the actual histogram.\n3. The keys for sorting needed to be the negative of the histogram to sort in descending order of frequency.\n\nBy fixing these, the function should work as intended.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4624, "completion_tokens": 3820, "total_tokens": 8444}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
