Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to count how many times each token occurs. The current code uses Select with EQ on tokens, then takes the SelectorWidth. Wait, but Select creates a matrix where each row corresponds to a token, and each column is whether it's equal to another token. So SelectorWidth would sum the Trues for each row, which is the count of occurrences. That seems correct. But in the example, when the input is \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1], which matches the counts. So maybe make_hist() is okay. But I should double-check.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It sorts vals based on keys, assuming unique keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector where keys are less than others. Then it uses SelectorWidth to get the count of smaller keys for each position. Then it creates sel_new by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals with sel_new. Wait, but target_pos is the count of smaller keys. So for each position, it's trying to find where the count equals the index. That might not correctly map the positions. Maybe the issue is that the indices start at 0, but the counts start at 0 as well. For example, if a key is the smallest, its count is 0, so it would map to index 0. That seems correct. But I'm not sure if the aggregation is correctly picking the right elements. Maybe the problem is that when multiple elements have the same key, the sorting isn't stable. But the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so perhaps it's fine.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them with indices. The keys are modified by adding min_key * i + max_seq_len. Wait, min_key is a float, but adding it multiplied by i (which is an index, starting from 0) might not ensure uniqueness correctly. Also, the example shows that when keys are [2,4,1,2], after adjustment, they become unique, allowing make_sort_unique to sort them. But in the code, the lambda is x + min_key * i + max_seq_len. Wait, but min_key is a float, and i is an integer. Maybe using min_key as 1, which is an integer, would be better. Also, the adjustment should ensure that each key is unique by adding a value that depends on the index. But perhaps the formula should be x + (min_key + i) * max_seq_len, to ensure that the added part is larger than any possible x. Alternatively, maybe the current formula isn't sufficient. For example, if max_seq_len is 5 and min_key is 1, then for i=0, it's x + 0 +5 = x+5. For i=1, x +1 +5 =x+6, etc. That would make each key unique because the added part increases with i. So that seems correct.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It's supposed to sort tokens by their frequency, with ties broken by their original position. The code computes hist as -1 * make_hist(), which inverts the counts so that higher frequencies become lower negative numbers. Then it sorts using make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, but make_sort uses the keys to sort, so using negative hist would sort in ascending order of frequency, which is correct because higher frequency tokens should come first. But wait, in the example, when the input is [2,4,2,1], the frequencies are 2:2, 4:1, 1:1. So hist would be [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when sorted, the tokens with higher frequency (lower hist) come first. So the sorted order should be 2,2,4,1. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which matches. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, make_sort_freq is defined as taking max_seq_len as an argument, but in the example, it's called with 5. However, in the function definition, it's written as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function should take more arguments. Oh, wait, looking back, the user provided code has make_sort_freq defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter, but in the example, it's called with three arguments. That's a problem. The function signature doesn't match the usage.\n\nSo the issue is in make_sort_freq. The function is supposed to take vals and keys, but in the current code, it's only taking max_seq_len. That's incorrect. The correct function should take vals and keys, similar to make_sort. So the function definition should be def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. Then, inside, it computes the hist based on keys, not on tokens. Because the keys are the tokens whose frequencies we want to count.\n\nWait, in the current code, make_sort_freq is using rasp.tokens as both vals and keys, but that's incorrect. It should be using the provided keys to compute the histogram. So the function should be modified to accept vals and keys, compute the histogram of keys, then sort vals based on the frequency of keys.\n\nSo putting it all together, the issues are:\n\n1. make_sort_freq's function signature is incorrect. It should accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n2. Inside make_sort_freq, the hist is computed on the provided keys, not on rasp.tokens.\n\n3. The example usage in the docstring is incorrect because it's passing three arguments, but the function only takes one.\n\nSo the repair involves fixing the function signature and the computation of hist.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort, the lambda function for adjusting keys might need to ensure that the added value is sufficient to make all keys unique. Perhaps using max_seq_len as a multiplier would be better, but the current approach seems to work as per the example.\n\nAnother thing to check is the use of named() in the functions. They are correctly named, which is good for debugging.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Modify make_sort_freq to accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n- Compute hist based on keys, not tokens.\n\n- Update the example usage in the docstring accordingly.\n\nLet me rewrite make_sort_freq accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2384, "total_tokens": 7007}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
