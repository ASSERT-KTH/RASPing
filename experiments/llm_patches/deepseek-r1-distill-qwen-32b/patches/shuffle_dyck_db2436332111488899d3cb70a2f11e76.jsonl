It now correctly identifies close tokens using equality.\n\nHere is the repaired code:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_length()`. It creates a selector where all comparisons are true, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count, which should be the length of the sequence. That seems correct.\n\nNext, `make_frac_prevs(bools)`. It uses a Select with LEQ to get previous indices, then aggregates. Wait, the Select uses indices for both keys and queries with LEQ. That should create a lower triangular matrix where each row i has True for columns 0 to i. Then, aggregating bools with this selector should sum all previous bools up to current index. But the function returns the numerical value of this aggregate. However, the example expects fractions, so maybe it's missing division by the count of previous elements. Oh, right, because the current index is included in the selector. For example, at index 2, it includes 0,1,2. But the fraction should be over the number of previous elements, which is index+1. So the current code sums up to current index, but to get the fraction, we need to divide by (index + 1). So the function is incorrect because it doesn't normalize by the count.\n\nMoving on to `make_pair_balance(sop, open_token, close_token)`. It creates bools for open and close tokens. Then computes frac_prevs for opens and closes. Wait, for the close token, it's using sop != close_token, which would be True when it's not a close token. That doesn't make sense. It should be True when it is a close token. So that line is incorrect. It should be sop == close_token, but then in the balance, subtract the fraction of close tokens. Alternatively, perhaps the bools_close is incorrectly defined.\n\nLooking at the code: bools_close is set to sop != close_token. That means it's True when the token is not a close token. Then, make_frac_prevs(bools_close) would count the fraction of previous tokens that are not close tokens. But that's the opposite of what we need. We want the fraction of previous close tokens. So this is a bug. It should be sop == close_token.\n\nThen, pair_balance is computed as opens minus closes. But if bools_close is incorrect, the result will be wrong.\n\nNow, `make_shuffle_dyck(pairs)`. It computes balances for each pair, checks if any balance is negative, and if the last balance is zero. Then combines these to determine if the parentheses are balanced.\n\nLooking at the code, in make_shuffle_dyck, the any_negative is created by OR-ing all balances being less than zero. Then, it's converted to numerical. But when using Aggregate with select_all, which is a selector where all are True, it averages all the any_negative values. However, any_negative is a boolean SOp, and when converted to numerical, True becomes 1 and False becomes 0. So the Aggregate would compute the mean of 1s and 0s across the sequence. But the intention is to check if any position has a negative balance. So if any element in any_negative is True (1), then has_neg would be 1. But the current code uses Aggregate with default 0, which averages. So if any element is 1, the average would be greater than 0. But the code then uses has_neg as a numerical value, which is 1 if any balance was negative. However, the way it's used later is in a boolean context, so it might work, but it's not precise. It should instead check if any element is True, not average.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is a boolean SOp. Then, it's converted to numerical, which turns True into 1.0 and False into 0.0. Then, Aggregate with select_all would compute the mean of all 1s and 0s. So if any element is 1, the mean is positive. Then, has_neg is this mean. But in the final return, it's used in a boolean context: if has_neg is non-zero, it's considered True. So that part might work, but it's not the most efficient way. It would be better to use a selector that checks if any element is True and then use Aggregate to see if the sum is greater than zero.\n\nBut perhaps the main issue is in make_frac_prevs and make_pair_balance.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_frac_prevs, the function doesn't normalize by the count of previous elements. It just sums them, but to get the fraction, it needs to divide by (index + 1).\n\n2. In make_pair_balance, the bools_close is incorrectly set to sop != close_token. It should be sop == close_token.\n\n3. In make_shuffle_dyck, the way any_negative is computed might not correctly capture if any balance is negative. Using Aggregate with select_all averages the 1s and 0s, but perhaps a better approach is to use a selector that checks if any element is True and then use Aggregate to sum, then check if the sum is greater than zero.\n\nLet me address each issue.\n\nFor make_frac_prevs:\n\nThe current code sums all previous bools up to current index (including current). To get the fraction, we need to divide by (index + 1). So after aggregating, we should divide each element by its index + 1.\n\nBut how to get the index? We can use rasp.indices, which gives a sequence [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]. So for each position i, the count is i+1.\n\nSo, after aggregating, we can divide by (indices + 1). But since indices are 0-based, adding 1 gives 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nSo, the corrected make_frac_prevs would be:\n\nCompute the sum of previous bools using Aggregate with prevs selector. Then, divide each element by (index + 1).\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nsum_prevs = rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)\ncount = rasp.Map(lambda x: x + 1, rasp.indices)\nfrac_prevs = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda s, c: s / c, sum_prevs, count)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, bools is numerical, which converts True to 1.0 and False to 0.0. So the sum_prevs would be the count of True up to current index. Then, dividing by (index + 1) gives the fraction.\n\nSo, the corrected function would be:\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    sum_prevs = rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)\n    count = rasp.Map(lambda x: x + 1, rasp.indices)\n    frac_prevs = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda s, c: s / c, sum_prevs, count)\n    return rasp.numerical(frac_prevs).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the function returns the numerical value of the aggregate, which is the sum. So adding the division step is necessary.\n\nNext, in make_pair_balance:\n\nThe bools_close is incorrectly set to sop != close_token. It should be sop == close_token.\n\nSo, the corrected code would be:\n\nbools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n\nThen, the pair_balance is opens minus closes.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, closes is the fraction of previous close tokens. So pair_balance is opens - closes, which is correct.\n\nSo, the corrected function would have:\n\nbools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\ncloses = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\nNow, for make_shuffle_dyck:\n\nThe any_negative is computed as the OR of all balances being less than zero. Then, it's converted to numerical, which turns True into 1.0 and False into 0.0. Then, Aggregate with select_all computes the mean of these values. However, if any element is 1, the mean is positive, which would correctly indicate that there was at least one negative balance. But perhaps a better approach is to check if any element is True, which can be done by using a selector that selects all and then checking if the sum is greater than zero.\n\nAlternatively, since any_negative is a boolean SOp, we can use SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues, and if it's greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut perhaps the current approach works because if any element is 1, the mean is positive, and when converted to boolean, it's True. So the code might still work, but it's not the most efficient.\n\nHowever, another issue is that in the final return, it's using (last_zero & not_has_neg). But last_zero is the balance at the last position being zero, and not_has_neg is the negation of has_neg. So if any balance was negative, has_neg is True, so not_has_neg is False, making the final result False, which is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the way any_negative is computed can be improved. Instead of averaging, we can sum and check if it's greater than zero.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the main issues are in make_frac_prevs and make_pair_balance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the corrected code would involve:\n\n1. In make_frac_prevs, adding the division by (index + 1).\n\n2. In make_pair_balance, correcting the bools_close to use == instead of !=.\n\n3. Possibly, in make_shuffle_dyck, ensuring that any_negative correctly captures if any balance was negative.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_shuffle_dyck, the any_negative is computed as balances[0] < 0, then OR with other balances. But each balance is a sequence of floats. So any_negative is a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance at that position is negative. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which selects all positions, the mean would be the fraction of positions where any balance was negative. But the intention is to check if any position has a negative balance. So if any element in any_negative is True, then has_neg should be True.\n\nBut the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the numerical values (1s and 0s). So if any element is 1, the average is positive, which when converted to boolean is True. So has_neg would be 1.0 if any balance was negative.\n\nBut in the final return, it's used as not_has_neg, which is ~has_neg. So if has_neg is 1.0, not_has_neg is False. So the final result is last_zero & not_has_neg. So if any balance was negative, not_has_neg is False, making the result False, which is correct.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute has_neg as whether any element in any_negative is True. This can be done by using SelectorWidth on any_negative, which counts the number of Trues per position, then checking if any count is greater than zero.\n\nAlternatively, using Aggregate with a selector that selects all, and using a function that returns True if any element is True.\n\nBut perhaps the current approach is sufficient.\n\nAnother issue: in make_shuffle_dyck, the initial any_negative is balances[0] < 0. Then, for each subsequent balance, it's OR-ed. But the OR is done using the | operator on boolean SOps. However, in RASP, the | operator on selectors performs element-wise OR. So any_negative becomes a boolean SOp where each element is True if any of the balances at that position is negative.\n\nThen, when converted to numerical, it's 1.0 where True, 0.0 where False. Aggregating with select_all (which selects all) would compute the mean of these 1s and 0s across all positions. So if any position has a 1, the mean is positive, which when used in a boolean context is True. So has_neg is 1.0 if any position has a negative balance.\n\nBut perhaps a more accurate way is to check if the sum of any_negative is greater than zero. So instead of averaging, sum all elements and check if the sum is positive.\n\nBut in the current code, has_neg is the mean, which is sufficient because if any element is 1, the mean is positive.\n\nSo, perhaps the main issues are in make_frac_prevs and make_pair_balance.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n\nIn make_frac_prevs:\n\n- After aggregating, divide each element by (index + 1).\n\nIn make_pair_balance:\n\n- Correct the bools_close to use ==.\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck:\n\n- Ensure that any_negative correctly captures if any balance is negative.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_shuffle_dyck, the any_negative is computed as balances[0] < 0, then OR with other balances. But each balance is a sequence of floats. So any_negative is a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance at that position is negative. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which selects all positions, the mean is the fraction of positions where any balance was negative. But the intention is to check if any position has a negative balance. So if any element in any_negative is True, then has_neg should be True.\n\nBut the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the 1s and 0s. So if any element is 1, the average is positive, which when used in a boolean context is True. So has_neg is 1.0 if any balance was negative.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use SelectorWidth on any_negative, which counts the number of Trues per position, then check if any count is greater than zero.\n\nAlternatively, use a selector that selects all and then use Aggregate with a function that returns True if any element is True.\n\nBut perhaps the current approach is sufficient.\n\nAnother issue: in make_shuffle_dyck, the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg). But last_zero is the balance at the last position being zero, and not_has_neg is the negation of has_neg. So if any balance was negative, has_neg is True, so not_has_neg is False, making the final result False, which is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the way any_negative is computed can be improved. Instead of OR-ing all balances, perhaps using a selector that checks if any balance is negative.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the main issues.\n\nSo, the corrected code would be:\n\nIn make_frac_prevs:\n\nsum_prevs = rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)\ncount = rasp.Map(lambda x: x + 1, rasp.indices)\nfrac_prevs = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda s, c: s / c, sum_prevs, count)\nreturn rasp.numerical(frac_prevs).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\nIn make_pair_balance:\n\nbools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck:\n\nNo changes needed beyond the above.\n\nWait, but in make_frac_prevs, the original code didn't have the division. So adding that is necessary.\n\nAnother thing: in make_frac_prevs, the example expects [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5] for \"hello\". Let's see:\n\nIndices are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor each index i, the number of previous elements is i+1.\n\nAt index 0: 0 previous, so 0.\n\nAt index 1: 1 previous, so 0.\n\nAt index 2: 2 previous elements (0 and 1). If the condition is True for 1 element, then 1/3? Wait, no. Wait, the example says:\n\nnum_l(\"hello\") returns [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\nWait, \"hello\" is ['h','e','l','l','o']\n\nAssuming bools is 1 when token is 'l'.\n\nSo at index 0: no previous, 0.\n\nIndex 1: previous is 0, which is 'h' \u2192 0.\n\nIndex 2: previous are 0 and 1 \u2192 'h' and 'e' \u2192 0 \u2192 0/3=0? But the example shows 1/3. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps the function is intended to include the current element as well. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the Select with LEQ includes the current index. So for index i, it includes 0 to i. So the count is i+1.\n\nIn the example, for \"hello\", the 'l's are at indices 2 and 3.\n\nSo for each position:\n\ni=0: no 'l's \u2192 0.\n\ni=1: no 'l's \u2192 0.\n\ni=2: one 'l' (at 2) \u2192 1/(2+1) = 1/3.\n\ni=3: two 'l's (at 2 and 3) \u2192 2/(3+1)= 0.5.\n\ni=4: two 'l's \u2192 2/(4+1)= 2/5.\n\nWhich matches the example. So the corrected make_frac_prevs is correct.\n\nAnother issue: in make_pair_balance, the bools_close was using !=, which is incorrect. So correcting that to == is necessary.\n\nNow, putting all together, the corrected code would involve these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop != close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] == 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
