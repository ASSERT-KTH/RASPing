Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select to create a selector where tokens are equal, then uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. That should give the frequency of each token. But wait, in the example, when the input is \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1]. Let me think: each token's count is correctly calculated. So make_hist seems okay.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It sorts vals based on keys. It creates a selector where keys are less than each other, then uses SelectorWidth to get target positions. Then it creates a new selector comparing target_pos with indices and aggregates. Hmm, but when keys are not unique, this might not work correctly because the SelectorWidth could have the same value for different keys, leading to incorrect ordering. But the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so maybe it's fine as is.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them with indices. The keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Wait, in the code, it's using min_key as a parameter, but in the function definition, min_key is passed as 2 in make_sort_freq. Is that correct? Also, in the example, when keys are [2,4,1,2], after adjustment, they become unique, allowing make_sort_unique to sort them correctly. But I'm not sure if the adjustment is correctly applied. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the keys are modified using a SequenceMap that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But min_key is passed as 2 in make_sort_freq. Is that the right approach? Maybe, but perhaps the adjustment should be based on the position to ensure uniqueness.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(), it calls make_sort with hist as keys, which is negative frequencies. But wait, hist is created by make_hist(), which counts occurrences. So higher frequency tokens will have higher negative values, meaning they should come first. But in the example, when input is [2,4,2,1], the frequencies are 2:2, 4:1, 1:1. So hist would be [2,1,2,1], but negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when sorted, the tokens with higher frequency (more negative keys) come first. So the output should be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort uses min_key=2. Is that correct? Because in make_sort, min_key is used to adjust the keys. Maybe it's better to calculate min_key dynamically based on the sequence length.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort_freq(), the function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) but in the example usage, it's called with make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function expects more arguments. Oh, wait, looking back, the user provided code has make_sort_freq with parameters (vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int), but in the code I'm supposed to repair, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. That's a problem because the example calls it with three arguments, but the function only accepts one. So that's an error. I need to fix the function signature.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq(), the line return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key= 2) is using min_key=2, but perhaps it should be calculated based on max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Alternatively, maybe min_key should be 1 or another value.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort(), the keys are modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if min_key is 2, and max_seq_len is 5, then for i=0, it's x + 0, i=1, x + 0.4, etc. But if the original keys are integers, adding fractions might not be the best approach. Maybe it's better to scale min_key by max_seq_len to ensure that the added value is unique per position.\n\nWait, perhaps the adjustment should be min_key * i, not divided by max_seq_len. Because if you divide, the added value might be too small, especially for larger max_seq_len, leading to possible overlaps. For example, if max_seq_len is 5, min_key is 2, then for i=0, add 0; i=1, add 0.4; i=2, add 0.8, etc. But if two keys are the same, adding 0.4 and 0.8 might not be enough to make them unique. So perhaps it's better to multiply i by min_key without dividing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjustment should be min_key * (i + 1) to ensure that each position adds a unique value. Or maybe use a larger min_key to make the adjustment more significant.\n\nWait, looking back at the example in make_sort(), when keys are [2,4,3,1], after adjustment with max_seq_len=5 and min_key=1, the keys become [2,4.2,3.4,1.6], which when sorted would be 1.6, 2, 3.4, 4.2, leading to the correct order. But if min_key is 2, the adjustment would be larger, which might be better to ensure uniqueness.\n\nBut in make_sort_freq(), the min_key is hardcoded to 2. Maybe it's better to calculate it based on the maximum possible frequency or another parameter.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort_freq(), the function is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency, with ties broken by their original order. But the current implementation uses the negative frequency as the key, which when passed to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, would result in higher frequencies coming first. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the example: input [2,4,2,1]. The frequencies are 2:2, 4:1, 1:1. So hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when sorted, the keys are -2, -2, -1, -1. The adjusted keys would be -2 + (min_key * i / max_seq_len). If max_seq_len is 4, and min_key is 2, then for i=0: -2 + 0 = -2; i=1: -1 + 0.5 = -0.5; i=2: -2 + 1 = -1; i=3: -1 + 1.5 = 0.5. Wait, that would make the adjusted keys [-2, -0.5, -1, 0.5]. Sorting these would give -2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, which corresponds to positions 0, 2, 1, 3. So the output would be tokens[0], tokens[2], tokens[1], tokens[3], which are 2,2,4,1. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, make_sort_freq() is defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter, but in the example, it's called with three arguments. So the function signature is incorrect. It should accept vals and keys as well.\n\nSo, the first issue is that make_sort_freq() is missing parameters. It should be def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort(), the keys are adjusted using min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if max_seq_len is large, the adjustment might be too small, leading to possible overlaps. Maybe it's better to multiply by a larger factor or use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the adjustment should be min_key * (i + 1) to ensure that each position's adjustment is unique and increases with i. Alternatively, use a larger min_key to make the adjustment more significant.\n\nBut in the example, using min_key=2 and max_seq_len=5, the adjustment for i=0 is 0, i=1 is 0.4, etc. That seems small, but perhaps it's sufficient as long as it's consistent.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the line return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key= 2) is using rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. But hist is the frequency, which is correct. However, the min_key is hardcoded to 2. Maybe it should be a parameter or calculated based on max_seq_len.\n\nWait, perhaps the min_key should be 1, as in the make_sort() example. Using 2 might cause issues if the frequencies are larger than 2. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate min_key as 1 / max_seq_len to ensure that the adjustment is small but unique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjustment should be based on the position in a way that ensures uniqueness without affecting the sorting order too much.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of adding a fraction, multiply the position by a small value. For example, min_key could be 1e-6, and then each position's adjustment is i * min_key. This way, the adjustment is minimal but ensures uniqueness.\n\nBut in the current code, min_key is passed as 2, which might be too large. Let me think: if the original keys are [2,4,3,1], and min_key is 2, max_seq_len is 5, then the adjustment for i=0 is 0, i=1 is 0.4, i=2 is 0.8, i=3 is 1.2. So the adjusted keys become [2,4.4,3.8,2.2]. Sorting these would give 2, 2.2, 3.8, 4.4, which corresponds to the original indices 0,3,2,1. So the output would be [2,1,3,4], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4]. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal keys: [2,4,3,1]\nmax_seq_len=5, min_key=2\nFor each position i (0-based):\ni=0: 2 + 2*0/5 = 2\ni=1:4 + 2*1/5=4.4\ni=2:3 + 2*2/5=3.8\ni=3:1 + 2*3/5=1.6\n\nSo the adjusted keys are [2,4.4,3.8,1.6]. Sorting these in ascending order gives 1.6, 2, 3.8, 4.4. The corresponding indices are 3,0,2,1. So the output would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the adjustment seems to work. But perhaps using min_key=1 would be better to keep the adjustment minimal.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the min_key is hardcoded to 2. Maybe it's better to calculate it based on the maximum possible frequency or another parameter to ensure that the adjustment is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjustment should be done differently. For example, using a unique identifier for each position that doesn't interfere with the original keys. Maybe using a very small value multiplied by the position.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the main issue is the function signature of make_sort_freq(). It's missing the vals and keys parameters. So I need to fix that.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), the function is named as make_sort_freq(), but in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). So the function should accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\nSo, the corrected function signature should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nAlso, in the return statement, it's using rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. But if the function is supposed to sort the vals based on the frequency of the keys, then perhaps vals should be the tokens, and keys should be the frequencies. So the current code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key= 2).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut make_hist() returns the frequency of each token. So hist is the frequency, and we're using it as keys. Then, vals is rasp.tokens, which are the tokens themselves. So when sorted, the tokens will be ordered by their frequency (higher first), and for ties, by their position.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1], and the output is [2,2,4,1]. So the tokens are ordered by their frequency, and for tokens with the same frequency, they appear in the order they first occurred.\n\nBut in the current code, the keys are the negative frequencies, so when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. That seems correct.\n\nAnother potential issue: in make_sort(), the keys are modified, but if the original keys are not numerical, this might cause issues. But the function note says it only works for numerical keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. make_sort_freq() has an incorrect function signature. It's missing the vals and keys parameters.\n\n2. The min_key is hardcoded to 2 in make_sort_freq(), which might not be optimal. Perhaps it should be a parameter or calculated based on max_seq_len.\n\n3. In make_sort(), the adjustment to keys might be too small if max_seq_len is large, potentially causing overlaps. But given the example, it seems to work.\n\nSo, the main fix is to correct the function signature of make_sort_freq().\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the min_key should be a parameter or calculated dynamically. But for now, let's fix the function signature.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the function is named as make_sort_freq(), but in the example, it's called with make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). So the function should accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\nSo, the corrected code for make_sort_freq() should have the correct signature and parameters.\n\nAlso, in the return statement, the min_key is hardcoded to 2. Maybe it's better to pass it as a parameter or calculate it based on max_seq_len.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the min_key should be 1 to keep the adjustment minimal.\n\nWait, in the example, using min_key=2 works, but perhaps using min_key=1 is better to minimize the impact on the original keys.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq(), change min_key=2 to min_key=1.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the keys are modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if max_seq_len is 0, this would cause a division by zero. But since max_seq_len is a parameter passed by the user, it's their responsibility to ensure it's not zero.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Fix the function signature of make_sort_freq() to accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n- Change the min_key in make_sort_freq() from 2 to 1.\n\n- Ensure that all function calls are correct.\n\nLet me rewrite the functions with these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4624, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 8720}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
