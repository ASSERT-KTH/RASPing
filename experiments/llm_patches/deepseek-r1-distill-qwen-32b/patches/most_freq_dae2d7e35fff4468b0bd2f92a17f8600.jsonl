This prevents ties and ensures correct sorting.\n\n- **Stability in Sorting**: The revised approach in `make_sort_unique` and `make_sort` ensures that when keys are equal, the original order is preserved, providing stable sorting.\n\nThese changes ensure the RASP programs function correctly, handle ties appropriately, and maintain numerical stability.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP programs. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select to create a selector where tokens are equal, then uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. That should give the frequency of each token. But wait, in the example, when the input is \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1]. Let me think: each token's count is correctly calculated. So make_hist seems okay.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It sorts vals based on keys. It creates a selector where keys are less than each other, then uses SelectorWidth to get target positions. Then it aggregates vals based on these positions. Hmm, but when keys are unique, this should work. But I'm not sure if the aggregation is correctly mapping the positions. Maybe the issue is that when multiple keys are the same, the sorting isn't stable. But the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so perhaps it's correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them with indices. The keys are modified using a SequenceMap that adds min_key^i / max_seq_len. Wait, min_key is a float, and raising it to the power of i (which could be up to max_seq_len) might cause issues. For example, if min_key is 1, 1^i is always 1, so adding 1 / max_seq_len each time. But if max_seq_len is large, this might not sufficiently separate the keys. Also, using min_key as an exponent could lead to very small or large values depending on i. Maybe a better approach is to scale the index in a way that ensures uniqueness without causing numerical instability.\n\nLooking at the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after adjustment, they become unique, allowing make_sort_unique to sort them correctly. But perhaps the adjustment isn't sufficient in some cases, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it to get frequencies, and sorts tokens based on these frequencies. The problem is that when frequencies are the same, the tokens should retain their original order. But the current implementation might not handle this correctly because the keys (hist) are being sorted, but if two tokens have the same frequency, their order depends on their original positions. However, the way make_sort is called might not preserve the original order because the keys are being adjusted with indices, which could disrupt the intended behavior.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram values. So higher frequency tokens come first. But when frequencies are the same, the keys would be the same, so the sorting might not maintain the original order. To fix this, the sorting function should be stable, meaning that when keys are equal, the original order is preserved.\n\nLooking back at make_sort_unique, it uses the SelectorWidth of the 'smaller' selector to determine target positions. Then, it aggregates vals based on these positions. But if two keys are equal, their target positions might be the same, leading to incorrect aggregation. So the issue is that make_sort_unique doesn't handle ties correctly, which affects make_sort_freq when frequencies are the same.\n\nAnother issue is in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) but in the example usage, it's called with three arguments: make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't match the function signature. So that's a bug. The function should probably take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). So the function is missing parameters. It should take vals and keys as arguments, not just max_seq_len.\n\nSo the first fix is to correct the function signature of make_sort_freq to include vals and keys.\n\nNext, in make_sort, the way keys are adjusted might not be the best approach. Using min_key^i could lead to very small numbers if min_key is less than 1, which might not effectively break ties. Instead, perhaps adding a small epsilon based on the index would be better. For example, adding i / max_seq_len^2 to ensure that each key is unique without causing numerical issues.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_unique, the aggregation might not correctly handle cases where multiple keys are the same, leading to incorrect sorting when there are ties.\n\nAnother issue is that in make_sort_freq, the histogram is negated, but if the histogram is zero (for tokens not present), this could cause issues. However, since the input is the tokens themselves, each token's count should be at least 1, so the histogram shouldn't have zeros.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. make_sort_freq has an incorrect function signature, missing vals and keys parameters.\n2. The key adjustment in make_sort might not effectively handle all cases, especially when min_key is 1, leading to small increments that might not be sufficient.\n3. make_sort_unique doesn't handle ties correctly, which affects the stability of the sort.\n\nTo fix these:\n\n- Update make_sort_freq to accept vals and keys.\n- Adjust the key modification in make_sort to use a more reliable method for ensuring uniqueness.\n- Ensure that the sorting functions maintain stability when keys are equal.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Correct make_sort_freq's signature to include vals and keys.\n2. Modify the key adjustment in make_sort to add a small value based on the index, ensuring uniqueness without numerical issues.\n3. Test the functions with examples to ensure they produce the correct outputs.\n\nNow, implementing these changes in code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2271, "total_tokens": 6894}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key ** i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.0}
