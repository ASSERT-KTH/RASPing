This has been corrected to use equality.\n\n2. **Incorrect Combination of Results in `make_shuffle_dyck()`**: The final result was using a boolean AND operation between numerical and boolean SOps, which is not supported. Instead, we now use a `SequenceMap` to multiply the numerical results, ensuring the correct logical AND operation.\n\nHere is the repaired code:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are true, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count, which should be the length of the sequence. But wait, the Selector uses rasp.tokens as both keys and queries with Comparison.TRUE. That should create a selector where every element is True, so SelectorWidth would return the number of Trues per row, which is the length. However, when we run it, does it correctly return a sequence where each element is the length? Let me think about the example given: for \"abcdefg\", each element should be 7.0. That makes sense because the selector is all True, so each row has 7 Trues, hence SelectorWidth returns 7 for each position. So make_length() seems correct.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). This function counts the fraction of previous tokens where a condition was True. It uses a selector with LEQ on indices, which should select all previous positions including the current one. Then it aggregates the boolean values. Wait, but the example shows that for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]. Let's see: for each position i, it's counting the number of Trues in positions 0 to i, then dividing by (i+1). But in the code, the selector is LEQ on indices, which includes the current index. So when aggregating, it's averaging from 0 to i, which is correct. However, the initial code uses rasp.numerical(bools) which converts booleans to 1s and 0s. Then, the Aggregate uses default=0. But wait, in RASP, when using Aggregate, if no elements are selected, it returns the default. But in this case, since the selector is LEQ, every position i will have i+1 elements selected, so default shouldn't be hit. But the example shows that for the first element, it's 0, which is correct because there are no previous elements. Wait, no\u2014the first element includes itself, so if the condition is True at position 0, it would count as 1/1=1. But in the example, the first element is 0. Hmm, maybe the condition is set to False for the first element. Let me check the example: num_l is created with rasp.tokens == \"l\". For \"hello\", the tokens are ['h','e','l','l','o']. So at position 2, token is 'l', which is True. So for position 0: no 'l's before, so 0. Position 1: same, 0. Position 2: one 'l' (itself), so 1/3? Wait, no\u2014because the selector includes up to current index. So for position 2, it's considering indices 0,1,2. If only index 2 is True, then 1/3. That matches the example. So the code seems correct. But wait, the code uses rasp.numerical on the result of Aggregate. The Aggregate returns the average, which is correct. So make_frac_prevs() seems okay.\n\nNow, make_pair_balance(). This function computes the difference between the fraction of open and close tokens. It creates bools_open as sop < open_token. Wait, is that correct? Because if sop is the tokens, then sop < open_token would be True when the token is less than the open token. But for parentheses, we want to check equality. Oh, that's a bug. Instead of sop < open_token, it should be sop == open_token. Similarly for close_token. So in the code, bools_open is using sop < open_token, which is incorrect. It should be sop == open_token. Same for bools_close. That's a mistake. So that's one issue.\n\nMoving on to make_shuffle_dyck(). This function checks if all parentheses are balanced. It computes the balance for each pair, then checks if any balance went negative and if the final balance is zero. Let's see the code.\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck(), for each pair, it creates a balance using make_pair_balance. Then, any_negative is the OR of all balances being less than zero. Then, it converts any_negative to numerical and aggregates with select_all, which averages all elements. Wait, but any_negative is a sequence of booleans. Aggregating with select_all (all True) would average all the 1s and 0s. So has_neg would be 1 if any position had a negative balance, else 0. Then, all_zero checks if all balances are zero at the end. It uses select_last to get the last element of all_zero. Then, last_zero is the average of the selected elements, which in this case is just the last element. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse of has_neg. Finally, it returns last_zero AND not_has_neg.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is created by OR-ing all the balance < 0. Then, has_neg is the average of any_negative. But if any element in any_negative is True (1), then the average would be greater than 0, so has_neg would be non-zero. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse, which would be False if any_negative is True. But the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg). Wait, but last_zero is the last element of all_zero, which is 1 only if all balances are zero at the end. And not_has_neg is True only if has_neg is zero, meaning no negatives. So the final result is 1 only if both conditions are met: all balances are zero at the end, and no negatives occurred.\n\nBut wait, the code uses (last_zero & not_has_neg). However, last_zero is a numerical value (0 or 1), and not_has_neg is a boolean. The & operator between a numerical and a boolean might not work as intended. Also, the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"). But in RASP, the & operator is for selectors, not for numerical values. So this might be incorrect.\n\nAnother issue: in make_pair_balance(), the bools_open and bools_close are using sop < open_token and sop == close_token. As I noticed earlier, this is incorrect. It should be equality checks.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), the conditions for bools_open and bools_close are incorrect. They should use equality instead of less than.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the final aggregation for has_neg is using select_all, which averages all elements. However, we need to check if any element is True. Using Aggregate with select_all would return the average, which is non-zero if any element is True. But then, not_has_neg is the inverse of has_neg, which is correct. However, the final combination uses & between last_zero (a numerical SOp) and not_has_neg (a boolean SOp), which might not work as intended. Instead, perhaps we should convert everything to numerical and use multiplication or something else.\n\nWait, let me think again. The any_negative is a boolean sequence. When we aggregate with select_all, it's averaging all the 1s and 0s. So has_neg will be 1 if any element is True, else 0. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse, which is 1 only if has_neg is 0. So not_has_neg is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if there were no negatives, else 0.\n\nWait, no. Because has_neg is the result of Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0). So for each position, it's the average of all elements in any_negative. But any_negative is a sequence where each element is 1 if any balance was negative up to that point. Wait, no: any_negative is a sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position. So when we aggregate with select_all, for each position i, it's the average of any_negative[0..i], which is 1 if any of them is True. Because if any is True, the average is >=1/(i+1), but since we're using numerical values, it's 1 if any is True, else 0. Wait, no: the Aggregate function averages the selected elements. So if any element in any_negative is True (1), then the average will be at least 1/(length). But we want has_neg to be 1 if any balance was negative anywhere, else 0. So perhaps using Aggregate is not the right approach. Instead, we should check if any element in any_negative is True. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use SelectorWidth on any_negative. Because SelectorWidth returns the count of True per row. If any_negative has any True in a row, the count is >=1. So maybe has_neg should be SelectorWidth(any_negative) > 0. But that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the current approach is incorrect. Because has_neg is computed as the average of any_negative across all positions. But what we need is whether any position had a negative balance. So has_neg should be 1 if any element in any_negative is True, else 0. But the current code computes the average, which would be non-zero if any element is True. However, when we invert it with ~has_neg, it would be True only if has_neg is zero, i.e., no negatives. But the final result is last_zero & not_has_neg. But last_zero is a numerical SOp (0 or 1), and not_has_neg is a boolean. So the & operator might not work as intended because one is numerical and the other is boolean.\n\nWait, in RASP, the & operator is for selectors, not for numerical values. So combining a numerical SOp with a boolean SOp using & might not produce the desired result. Instead, perhaps we should convert both to numerical and multiply them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final step should be a SequenceMap that combines last_zero and not_has_neg using a logical AND.\n\nSo, to fix the issues:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), change the conditions to use equality.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), adjust the way has_neg is computed and how it's combined with last_zero.\n\nLet me go through each function step by step.\n\nFirst, make_pair_balance():\n\nThe function is supposed to return the fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of previous close tokens. The current code uses sop < open_token for bools_open, which is incorrect. It should be sop == open_token. Similarly for bools_close.\n\nSo, I'll change:\n\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop < open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n\nto\n\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n\nAnd similarly for bools_close.\n\nNext, make_shuffle_dyck():\n\nThe function computes balances for each pair, then checks if any balance went negative and if the final balance is zero.\n\nThe any_negative is created by OR-ing all the balance < 0. Then, has_neg is computed as the average of any_negative across all positions. But this approach might not correctly capture whether any position had a negative balance. Because if any position is True, the average is non-zero, but it's not exactly 1. However, in the final step, not_has_neg is the inverse of has_neg, which would be True only if has_neg is zero, i.e., no negatives. So perhaps this part is correct.\n\nBut the final combination uses (last_zero & not_has_neg). Since last_zero is a numerical SOp (0 or 1) and not_has_neg is a boolean, the & operator might not work as intended. Instead, perhaps we should convert both to numerical and multiply them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a SequenceMap to combine them with a logical AND.\n\nWait, let's think about the types. last_zero is the result of Aggregate(select_last, all_zero), which returns a numerical value (0 or 1) for each position. But since select_last selects only the last element, last_zero will have the same value for all positions, which is 1 if the last balance is zero, else 0.\n\nnot_has_neg is the inverse of has_neg, which is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if there were no negatives, else 0.\n\nSo, to compute the final result, which is 1 only if both conditions are met (last_zero is 1 and not_has_neg is 1), we can multiply them element-wise.\n\nSo, instead of returning (last_zero & not_has_neg), we should return a SequenceMap that multiplies them.\n\nAlternatively, since both are numerical, we can use a LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and 1, but that would add them. Instead, we need to multiply.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nfinal = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x * y, last_zero, not_has_neg)\n\nBut wait, last_zero is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if the last balance is zero, else 0. not_has_neg is 1 if there were no negatives, else 0. So multiplying them would give 1 only if both are 1.\n\nBut wait, last_zero is the same for all positions because it's the last element. So the result would be the same across all positions, which is correct because the shuffle_dyck function should return 1 for all positions if the entire sequence is balanced, else 0.\n\nWait, no. The example shows that for \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1], meaning all positions are 1. For \"(){)}\", it's [0,0,0,0,0]. So the function returns a sequence where each element is 1 if the entire input is balanced, else 0.\n\nSo, the final result should be a sequence where each element is 1 if both conditions are met, else 0.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute whether all balances are zero at the end (last_zero) and whether no balance went negative (not_has_neg). Then, the final result is 1 only if both are true.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfinal = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1 if x else 0, last_zero * not_has_neg)\n\nWait, but last_zero is a numerical SOp, and not_has_neg is also numerical. So multiplying them would give 1 only if both are 1.\n\nBut in RASP, to multiply two numerical SOps element-wise, we can use SequenceMap with a lambda x,y: x * y.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nproduct = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x * y, last_zero, not_has_neg)\nresult = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1 if x else 0, product)\n\nBut wait, last_zero is already 0 or 1, and not_has_neg is 0 or 1. So their product is 1 only if both are 1. So the Map is unnecessary because the product is already 0 or 1.\n\nWait, no. Because last_zero is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if the last balance is zero, else 0. not_has_neg is 1 if there were no negatives, else 0. So their product is 1 only if both conditions are met. So the final result can be:\n\nreturn rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x * y, last_zero, not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\")\n\nBut wait, last_zero is a numerical SOp, and not_has_neg is also numerical. So using SequenceMap with multiplication is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since both are numerical, perhaps using a LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and 1 and then applying a threshold. But multiplication is more straightforward.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the changes are:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), fix the conditions to use equality.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), change the final combination from using & to using SequenceMap with multiplication.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if the initial code uses any functions that are not properly defined. For example, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the code uses 'length - 1', but length is an SOp. So subtracting 1 from an SOp might not work as intended. Instead, perhaps we should create a new SOp that represents length - 1.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nBut length is an SOp that returns the length for each position. So length - 1 would subtract 1 from each element, which is correct because indices are 0-based. So for a sequence of length 4, indices are 0,1,2,3. length is 4 for each position, so length -1 is 3 for each position. Then, select_last selects where indices == 3, which is the last element. So that part is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the code uses 'balance < 0' which is correct because if any balance went negative, it's unbalanced.\n\nSo, to summarize the repairs:\n\n- In make_pair_balance(), change the conditions to use equality.\n\n- In make_shuffle_dyck(), replace the final & operation with a SequenceMap that multiplies last_zero and not_has_neg.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop < open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] == 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
