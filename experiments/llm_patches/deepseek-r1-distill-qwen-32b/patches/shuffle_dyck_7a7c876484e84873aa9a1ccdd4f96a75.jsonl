Additionally, the `make_shuffle_dyck` function needed adjustments to correctly handle the aggregation of negative balances.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_length()`. It creates a selector where all comparisons are true, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count, which should be the length of the sequence. That seems correct.\n\nNext, `make_frac_prevs(bools)`. It converts bools to numerical values, then creates a selector where each element is less than or equal to its index. Then it aggregates these bools using the selector. Wait, the selector is using indices compared with LEQ, which might not correctly capture the previous elements. Because for each position i, it should consider all j <= i. But the way it's set up, when using Aggregate, each row i would sum all elements up to i, including itself. But the function is supposed to count the fraction of previous tokens, so maybe it should exclude the current element. Hmm, perhaps the selector should be LT instead of LEQ. Because for position i, previous tokens are j < i, not j <= i. So that's a bug. I'll need to change the Comparison from LEQ to LT.\n\nMoving on to `make_pair_balance(sop, open_token, close_token)`. It calculates the fraction of open and close tokens and subtracts them. It uses make_frac_prevs for both, which we've identified might have an issue. Also, when subtracting, the LinearSequenceMap uses 1 and -1, but since frac_prevs might include the current token, the balance could be incorrect. But the main issue is in make_frac_prevs, so fixing that should help.\n\nNow, `make_shuffle_dyck(pairs)`. This function checks if all parentheses are balanced. It computes the balance for each pair, checks if any balance is negative, and if the last balance is zero. But there's a problem in how it aggregates 'any_negative'. It uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all elements. But if any element is negative, the average would be negative, but we need a binary indicator: 1 if any are negative, 0 otherwise. Using Aggregate with default 0 might not correctly capture this because it's an average, not a logical OR. Instead, we should use a Selector that checks if any element is negative and then use SelectorWidth or another method to determine if any are negative.\n\nWait, in the code, any_negative is created by OR-ing whether each balance is negative. Then, it's converted to numerical and mapped. But when using Aggregate with select_all, it's taking the average of 1s and 0s, which would give a fraction, not a binary result. So if any element is 1 (negative), the average would be greater than 0. But the code then uses has_neg as this average. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse. But the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg). However, if has_neg is a fraction, not_has_neg would be 1 - fraction, which might not be binary. So this could cause issues.\n\nAnother issue is in the `make_frac_prevs` function. Let me think about how it's used. For each position i, it's supposed to count the fraction of previous tokens (before i) that are True. So for i=0, it's 0. For i=1, it's the fraction of tokens before 1 (i=0) that are True. The current implementation uses LEQ, which includes the current token. So for i=1, it includes i=0 and i=1, which is incorrect. We need to change the selector to use LT instead of LEQ so that each row i only includes j < i.\n\nSo, in `make_frac_prevs`, the line should be:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\nThat way, each position i only aggregates up to i-1.\n\nAdditionally, in `make_shuffle_dyck`, the way 'any_negative' is handled might not correctly produce a binary result. Instead of using Aggregate, perhaps we should create a selector that marks where any_negative is True and then check if any such positions exist.\n\nWait, but the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all the any_negative values. If any are 1, the average will be >0, which when used in a boolean context would be True. But in the code, 'has_neg' is then used as a numerical value. Then, 'not_has_neg' is the inverse, which would be 1 - has_neg. But if has_neg is, say, 0.5, not_has_neg would be 0.5, which when used in a boolean context might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should use SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector. Because any_negative is a Selector where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position. Then, SelectorWidth would count how many Trues are there. If the count is greater than 0, it means there's at least one negative balance.\n\nSo, in `make_shuffle_dyck`, instead of aggregating, we can compute the width of the any_negative selector. If the width is greater than 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP. Let me think.\n\nWe can create a selector that is True where any_negative is True. Then, compute its width. If the width is >0, then has_neg is True. But in RASP, we can't directly compute if the width is >0. Instead, perhaps we can use a Map to convert the width into 1 if >0, else 0.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return 1 if all parentheses are balanced, which requires two conditions: no negative balances anywhere, and all balances are zero at the end.\n\nSo, in the current code, 'has_neg' is the average of any_negative, which is 1 if any are True. But using Aggregate with default 0 might not be the right approach. Instead, perhaps we should compute whether any_negative has any True values.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the maximum of any_negative. If the maximum is True, then has_neg is True. But RASP doesn't have a max function directly. However, we can create a selector that is True if any element is True, and then use SelectorWidth to see if the count is >0.\n\nSo, perhaps in `make_shuffle_dyck`, after creating any_negative as a Selector, we can compute its width. If the width is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP. Let me think.\n\nWe can compute the width using SelectorWidth(any_negative), which gives a sequence where each element is the count of Trues up to that point. Wait, no, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values in each row of the selector. But any_negative is a Selector where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position. So, the width would be 1 if any position is negative, else 0. Wait, no, because each row in the selector corresponds to a position, and each element in the row is whether that position is negative. So, the width for each row would be the count of positions where any balance is negative up to that point. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the any_negative selector is a 1D selector where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position. Then, the width would be the count of True values in that selector. If the width is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut in RASP, the SelectorWidth returns a sequence where each element is the count of True values in each row. But if any_negative is a 1D selector (each row is a single boolean), then SelectorWidth would return a sequence of 1s and 0s, indicating whether each position is True. Then, to check if any are True, we can sum these and see if it's greater than zero.\n\nBut RASP doesn't have a sum function. Alternatively, we can use Aggregate with a selector that selects all positions, and use the sum as the aggregate. But that's not directly possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative values. But we need to know if any are True. So, perhaps instead of averaging, we should check if the maximum is True. But since we can't do that directly, maybe we can use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'any_negative' should be converted into a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position, else 0. Then, using SelectorWidth on any_negative would give a sequence where each element is 1 if any balance is negative up to that point. Wait, no, SelectorWidth gives the count per row, which in this case would be 1 if the position is negative, else 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the desired outcome. We need 'has_neg' to be 1 if any position has a negative balance, else 0. Then, 'not_has_neg' is the inverse.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of using Aggregate, we can compute the maximum of any_negative. But since RASP doesn't have a max function, perhaps we can use a trick. For example, using SelectorWidth on any_negative would give a sequence where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. Then, using SelectorWidth again on a selector that selects all positions, and checks if any of those are 1.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: create a selector that is True if any_negative is True at any position. Then, the width of this selector would be the count of positions where any_negative is True. If this count is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the issue is in the `make_frac_prevs` function. Let me focus on that first.\n\nIn `make_frac_prevs`, the selector uses LEQ, which includes the current element. So, for position i, it's including j <= i, which includes j=i. But we only want j < i. So changing the selector to use LT instead of LEQ would fix that.\n\nSo, in `make_frac_prevs`, the line should be:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\nThat way, each row i includes only j < i, which are the previous elements.\n\nNow, moving to `make_shuffle_dyck`. The function computes balances for each pair, then checks if any balance is negative anywhere, and if all balances are zero at the end.\n\nThe issue is in how 'any_negative' is handled. Currently, it's using Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative values. But we need to know if any are True. So, perhaps instead of aggregating, we can compute whether any_negative has any True values.\n\nWait, but any_negative is a Selector. To check if any element is True, perhaps we can compute its width. If the width is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nSo, in `make_shuffle_dyck`, after creating any_negative as a Selector, we can compute its width. If the width is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP. Let me think.\n\nWe can compute the width using SelectorWidth(any_negative), which gives a sequence where each element is the count of True values in each row. But since any_negative is a 1D selector (each row is a single boolean), the width would be 1 if the position is True, else 0.\n\nThen, to check if any position is True, we can sum these widths. If the sum is greater than zero, then has_neg is True. But RASP doesn't have a sum function. Alternatively, we can use Aggregate with a selector that selects all positions, and use the sum as the aggregate. But that's not directly possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: create a selector that is True if any_negative is True at any position. Then, the width of this selector would be the count of True positions. If this count is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to create such a selector. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that any_negative is a Selector, and then use SelectorWidth to get a sequence of 1s and 0s, and then use a Map to check if any are 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps:\n\n1. Compute any_negative as a Selector where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position.\n\n2. Compute the width of any_negative, which gives a sequence where each element is 1 if the corresponding position in any_negative is True, else 0.\n\n3. Then, compute whether any of these are 1. This can be done by checking if the maximum is 1, but since we don't have max, perhaps we can use a trick: use SelectorWidth on a selector that selects all positions where the width is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe the initial approach with Aggregate is acceptable, but we need to adjust how we handle the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with default=0, which returns the average. But we need a binary result: 1 if any are True, else 0. So, perhaps after aggregating, we can use a Map to convert any non-zero value to 1.\n\nWait, but in the code, 'has_neg' is used in a boolean context. So, if the average is greater than 0, it means at least one element was True. So, perhaps the current code is correct in that sense. But when we invert it with ~has_neg, which is 1 - has_neg, it might not be binary. So, perhaps we should instead use a Map to convert has_neg into a binary value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code doesn't correctly handle the case where all balances are zero except the last, which should be zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother potential issue is in the `make_pair_balance` function. It uses make_frac_prevs for both open and close tokens. If make_frac_prevs is fixed to use LT, then this should correctly count the fraction of previous opens and closes. Then, subtracting them should give the correct balance.\n\nPutting it all together, the main fixes needed are:\n\n1. In `make_frac_prevs`, change the selector from LEQ to LT.\n\n2. In `make_shuffle_dyck`, ensure that 'has_neg' correctly reflects whether any balance is negative. The current approach using Aggregate with select_all might be acceptable, but perhaps it's better to use SelectorWidth and then check if any are True.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the main fix is in `make_frac_prevs`.\n\nSo, the corrected code would have the following changes:\n\nIn `make_frac_prevs`, change:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n\nto:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\nAdditionally, in `make_shuffle_dyck`, the way 'any_negative' is handled might need adjustment, but perhaps the initial approach is sufficient once `make_frac_prevs` is fixed.\n\nWait, another issue: in `make_shuffle_dyck`, the 'any_negative' is created by OR-ing the conditions for each balance. But each balance is a sequence of fractions. So, when comparing balance < 0, it's a numerical comparison. Then, any_negative is a Selector where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position.\n\nThen, when we compute 'has_neg' as the average of any_negative, it's 1 if any are True, else 0. But using Aggregate with default=0, which averages the 1s and 0s. So, if any are True, the average is >0. Then, 'not_has_neg' is 1 - has_neg, which would be 0 if any are True, else 1.\n\nWait, no. Because 'has_neg' is the average, which is a float. So, if any are True, has_neg is >0. Then, 'not_has_neg' is 1 - has_neg, which would be less than 1 if any are True. But in the final return, we have (last_zero & not_has_neg). Since not_has_neg is a numerical SOp, the & operator would perform element-wise multiplication, treating non-zero as True. So, if has_neg is >0, not_has_neg is <1, which when multiplied by last_zero (which is 1 if all balances are zero at the end) would result in 0 if any are negative, else 1.\n\nWait, but the desired output is 1 if all parentheses are balanced, which requires two conditions: no negative balances anywhere, and all balances are zero at the end.\n\nSo, the current code's logic seems correct, but the issue is in how 'any_negative' is computed. Because if any balance is negative at any position, 'has_neg' would be >0, making 'not_has_neg' <1, thus the final result would be 0.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the current code uses 'any_negative' as a Selector, and then aggregates it, which might not correctly capture the presence of any negatives. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the main issue is in `make_frac_prevs`.\n\nIn conclusion, the main fix is in `make_frac_prevs` to use LT instead of LEQ. Additionally, in `make_shuffle_dyck`, perhaps the way 'any_negative' is handled is correct, but let's proceed with the fix for `make_frac_prevs`.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] > 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
