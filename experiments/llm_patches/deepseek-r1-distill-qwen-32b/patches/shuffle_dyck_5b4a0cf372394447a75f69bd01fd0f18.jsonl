Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. Since all are True, it should return the length. But in the example, when the input is \"abcdefg\", the output is [7.0, ..., 7.0], which is correct. Hmm, maybe that's fine.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It uses Select with LEQ on indices, which creates a lower triangular matrix. Then Aggregate is used with bools. But wait, Aggregate averages the selected values. So for each position i, it averages all bools up to i. But the example expects the fraction of previous Trues. For instance, at position 2 in \"hello\", it's 1/3. Let me see: the selector for i=2 would include positions 0,1,2. If bools are [0,0,1,0,0], then the average would be (0+0+1)/3 = 1/3, which is correct. So that seems right.\n\nNow, make_pair_balance(). It computes the fraction of open and close tokens and subtracts them. But wait, the function uses sop >= open_token for bools_open. Is that correct? Because if open_token is '(', then any token >= '(' would include all tokens that are letters after '(', which might not be intended. Oh, that's a problem. It should check equality, not greater than or equal. So bools_open should be sop == open_token, not >=. Same for bools_close.\n\nLooking at the example, when using make_pair_balance with \"(\", \")\", the bools_open should be 1 where token is '(', 0 otherwise. Using sop >= '(' would include all tokens that are letters after '(', which is incorrect. So that's a bug.\n\nMoving on to make_shuffle_dyck(). It computes balances for each pair, checks if any balance is negative, and if the last balance is zero. But let's see the implementation.\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is created by checking if any balance is less than zero. Then, it's converted to numerical. However, the way it's done might not correctly aggregate. Also, the has_neg is computed by aggregating any_negative with select_all, which averages all elements. But if any element is negative, the average would be non-zero, but it's not a boolean. So this might not correctly capture whether any balance was negative.\n\nWait, any_negative is a sequence of booleans (from balance < 0). Then, it's converted to numerical, which would turn True into 1.0 and False into 0.0. Then, Aggregate with select_all (all True) would average all 1s and 0s. So has_neg would be 1.0 if any balance was negative, else 0.0. But actually, if any balance is negative, the average would be greater than 0. So that part might be correct.\n\nBut the last_zero is computed by selecting the last element of all_zero. However, all_zero is a sequence where each element is True if all balances are zero at that position. Then, select_last selects the last element, and Aggregate averages it (but since it's a single element, it's just the value). So last_zero is True if all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nBut the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg). However, last_zero is a numerical SOp (from Aggregate), and not_has_neg is also numerical. The & operator might not work as intended because it's performing element-wise AND on numerical values, which could lead to incorrect results. Instead, we should convert these to boolean SOps before combining them.\n\nWait, in RASP, the & operator for numerical SOps would perform multiplication, not boolean AND. So that's incorrect. We need to ensure that we're combining boolean values, not numerical.\n\nSo, the issues I found are:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), bools_open and bools_close are using sop >= open_token and sop == close_token. The >= is incorrect for open_token; it should be ==.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the final combination of last_zero and not_has_neg is using numerical operations instead of boolean operations, which might not work correctly.\n\nLet me outline the repairs:\n\nFor make_pair_balance():\n- Change bools_open to use sop == open_token instead of >=.\n\nFor make_shuffle_dyck():\n- Ensure that any_negative is correctly computed as a boolean sequence.\n- When combining last_zero and not_has_neg, use boolean operations instead of numerical.\n\nWait, looking back, in make_shuffle_dyck(), any_negative is created by checking balance < 0, which is a boolean sequence. Then, it's converted to numerical, which turns True into 1.0. Then, Aggregate with select_all averages all 1s and 0s, so has_neg is 1.0 if any balance was negative. Then, not_has_neg is ~has_neg, which would be 0.0 if has_neg is 1.0, and 1.0 otherwise.\n\nBut when combining last_zero and not_has_neg, using & would multiply them as numerical values. So if last_zero is 1.0 and not_has_neg is 1.0, the result is 1.0. But we need a boolean result indicating whether both conditions are true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should keep the boolean nature throughout.\n\nWait, let me think again. The function make_shuffle_dyck() is supposed to return 1 if the parentheses are balanced, else 0. The conditions are:\n\n1. No balance ever goes negative (any_negative is False).\n2. The final balance is zero for all types.\n\nSo, the final result is True only if both conditions are met.\n\nIn the current code, any_negative is a numerical SOp where 1.0 indicates that some balance was negative. has_neg is the average of any_negative, which would be 1.0 if any element was 1.0. So not_has_neg is ~has_neg, which would be 0.0 if has_neg is 1.0, else 1.0.\n\nlast_zero is the value of all_zero at the last position. all_zero is a boolean sequence where each element is True if all balances are zero at that position. So the last element being True means all balances are zero at the end.\n\nBut when combining last_zero and not_has_neg, using & on numerical SOps would multiply them. So if last_zero is 1.0 and not_has_neg is 1.0, the result is 1.0. If either is 0.0, the result is 0.0. So that seems correct, but perhaps it's better to ensure that we're using boolean operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the final return is using numerical operations, but the function is supposed to return a boolean. However, in the example, the output is [1,1,1,1] for balanced and [0,0,0,0] for unbalanced, which suggests that the output is numerical 1s and 0s.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is 1s and 0s, which are numerical. So perhaps the current approach is correct, but the way any_negative is computed might be incorrect.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is computed as balances[0] < 0, then for each balance in balances[1:], any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0). But balance is a numerical SOp, so balance < 0 is a boolean SOp. Then, any_negative is a boolean SOp. But then, it's converted to numerical via rasp.numerical(). So any_negative becomes 1.0 where True, 0.0 where False.\n\nThen, has_neg is computed as the average of any_negative across all positions. So if any position has any_negative as 1.0, the average will be non-zero. But we need to check if any balance was negative at any position. So has_neg would be 1.0 if any balance was negative anywhere.\n\nThen, not_has_neg is ~has_neg, which would be 0.0 if has_neg is 1.0, else 1.0.\n\nBut the final result is (last_zero & not_has_neg). Since last_zero is a numerical SOp (from Aggregate, which returns numerical values), and not_has_neg is also numerical, the & operator would perform element-wise multiplication. So if both are 1.0, the result is 1.0; else, 0.0. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, when the input is \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1], which suggests that the function correctly identifies balanced parentheses. But perhaps the issue is elsewhere.\n\nWait, another potential issue: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the balances are computed for each pair, but the way any_negative is computed is by OR-ing all the individual balance < 0. However, each balance is a sequence, so any_negative becomes a sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position. Then, when we aggregate any_negative with select_all, we're taking the average across all positions. But if any position has any_negative as True, the average will be non-zero, indicating that there was at least one negative balance somewhere. So has_neg is 1.0 if any balance was negative at any position.\n\nBut wait, the Aggregate function averages the selected values. So if any_negative has any 1.0, the average will be >= 1/(length). So has_neg will be non-zero if any balance was negative. Then, not_has_neg is ~has_neg, which would be 0.0 if has_neg is non-zero, else 1.0.\n\nSo the final result is last_zero (whether all balances are zero at the end) multiplied by not_has_neg (whether no balance was negative anywhere). So if both are 1.0, the result is 1.0; else, 0.0.\n\nBut wait, in the example, when the input is \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1], which suggests that the function returns 1 for all positions. But according to the logic, it should return 1 only if all balances are zero at the end and no balance was negative anywhere. So perhaps the function is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back, the make_pair_balance() function has a bug in how it computes bools_open. It uses sop >= open_token, which is incorrect. It should be sop == open_token.\n\nSo, to fix make_pair_balance(), I need to change:\n\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop >= open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n\nto\n\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n\nSimilarly, bools_close is correctly using ==, so that's fine.\n\nAnother potential issue: in make_frac_prevs(), the selector is using LEQ on indices, which includes the current position. But the example expects the fraction of previous tokens, not including the current one. Wait, in the example, for \"hello\", the third position (index 2) has one 'l' in the previous two tokens, so 1/3. But if the selector includes the current position, then for index 2, it includes 0,1,2. If the current token is 'l', then it would count itself, leading to 2/3 instead of 1/3. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the example says:\n\nnum_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\nnum_l(\"hello\") returns [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\nLet's see: \"hello\" is ['h','e','l','l','o']\n\nFor each position i:\n\ni=0: no previous, so 0\ni=1: no previous, so 0\ni=2: previous are 0,1: no 'l's, so 0? But the example shows 1/3. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the selector should be LT instead of LEQ. Because LEQ includes the current index, which would include the current token in the count. But in the example, at position 2 (third character), the count is 1, which suggests that it's counting the 'l' at position 2. But the function is supposed to count the fraction of previous tokens, not including the current one.\n\nSo, the selector should be using LT instead of LEQ. Because for position i, we want to include all j < i, not j <= i.\n\nSo in make_frac_prevs(), the selector should be:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\ninstead of LEQ.\n\nThat's another bug.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), bools_open uses sop >= open_token, should be ==.\n\n2. In make_frac_prevs(), the selector uses LEQ, should be LT.\n\n3. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the final combination uses numerical & instead of boolean AND, but perhaps it's correct as is because the output is numerical 1s and 0s.\n\nWait, but in RASP, the & operator for numerical SOps would perform element-wise multiplication, which for 1s and 0s would work as a logical AND. So 1 * 1 = 1, 1 * 0 = 0, etc. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps we should convert the numerical values back to boolean before combining, but in this case, since the output is numerical, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the main fixes are in make_pair_balance() and make_frac_prevs().\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\nIn make_frac_prevs():\n\nChange the selector from LEQ to LT.\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\nIn make_pair_balance():\n\nChange bools_open to use == instead of >=.\n\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n\nNow, let me test these changes.\n\nFor make_frac_prevs(), with the selector using LT:\n\nFor input \"hello\", indices are [0,1,2,3,4].\n\nSelector for each i would include j < i.\n\nSo for i=2, j=0,1.\n\nIn the example, the bools are for 'l's: positions 2 and 3 are 'l's.\n\nSo for i=2, the previous tokens are 0 and 1: no 'l's. So the count is 0, fraction is 0/(2) = 0. But the example expects 1/3. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nWait, the example shows that for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5].\n\nWait, let's re-examine the example:\n\nnum_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\nnum_l(\"hello\") returns [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n\"hello\" is ['h','e','l','l','o']\n\nFor each position i:\n\ni=0: no previous, 0\ni=1: no previous, 0\ni=2: previous are 0,1: no 'l's, so 0. But the example shows 1/3. Hmm, that suggests that the current token is included.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code intended to include the current token in the count. So the selector should be LEQ, but the example expects that.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nIn the example, for i=2 (third character, 'l'), the fraction is 1/3. That suggests that up to and including i=2, there is 1 'l' (at i=2). So the count is 1, and the denominator is 3 (i+1). So the selector is using LEQ, including the current index.\n\nBut the function's docstring says it's counting the fraction of previous tokens, which would exclude the current token. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the function's docstring is incorrect, or the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the selector should be LEQ, and the function is intended to include the current token.\n\nBut according to the example, the function includes the current token in the count.\n\nSo, perhaps the selector should remain as LEQ, but the docstring is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is intended to count up to and including the current token, making the denominator i+1.\n\nIn that case, the selector should be LEQ.\n\nBut the example shows that for i=2, the count is 1, which is the 'l' at i=2. So the selector should include j <= i.\n\nThus, the original code is correct, and the issue is elsewhere.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the selector in make_frac_prevs() was using LEQ, which includes the current index, leading to including the current token in the count. But according to the example, that's what is desired.\n\nSo perhaps the initial analysis was wrong, and the selector should remain as LEQ.\n\nWait, but the function's name is make_frac_prevs, which suggests it's counting the fraction of previous tokens, not including the current one. So the example might be incorrect, or the function's implementation is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is intended to count up to and including the current token, making the denominator i+1.\n\nIn that case, the selector should be LEQ.\n\nBut given the example, it's better to keep the selector as LEQ.\n\nWait, but in the example, for i=2, the count is 1, which is the 'l' at i=2. So the selector includes j <= i.\n\nThus, the selector should remain as LEQ.\n\nSo perhaps the initial thought about changing it to LT was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is correct as is, and the issue is elsewhere.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the functions more carefully.\n\nAnother potential issue: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the select_last is using length - 1, but length is an SOp that returns the length of the sequence. However, in RASP, operations must be based on SOps, not on the length as a numerical value.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nBut length is an SOp that returns a sequence where each element is the length. So length - 1 would be an SOp that subtracts 1 from each element, resulting in a sequence where each element is (length -1).\n\nBut when used in Select, the keys are indices (0-based), and the queries are length-1. So for a sequence of length 4, queries would be 3 for all positions. So the selector would have True only where index == 3, i.e., the last element.\n\nBut"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop >= open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] == 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
