Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_length()`. It creates a selector where all comparisons are true, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count, which should be the length of the sequence. That seems correct.\n\nNext, `make_frac_prevs(bools)`. It converts bools to numerical values, then creates a selector where indices are less than or equal, which should capture all previous elements. Then it aggregates these to compute the fraction. Wait, but the aggregation averages the selected values. So for each position, it's the sum of previous bools divided by the count. That makes sense for the fraction. But I should check if the selector includes the current element. Oh, because LEQ includes the current index, so for position i, it includes 0 to i. But the example shows that for \"hello\", the third element is 1/3, which suggests that it's considering the first three elements. So maybe it's correct.\n\nMoving on to `make_pair_balance(sop, open_token, close_token)`. It creates two frac_prevs for opens and closes, then subtracts them. The LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and -1 should give the difference. That seems right.\n\nNow, `make_shuffle_dyck(pairs)`. The goal is to return 1 if all parentheses are balanced, else 0. Let's see.\n\nFirst, it computes balances for each pair. Then, it checks if any balance is negative anywhere. It aggregates this with select_all, which averages the any_negative across all positions. Wait, but any_negative is a boolean sequence. Aggregating with default 0 would average the 1s and 0s. So has_neg would be 1 if any position had a negative balance. That's correct.\n\nThen, it checks if all balances are zero at the end. It uses select_last to get the last element of all_zero. But wait, all_zero is a boolean sequence where each element is True if the corresponding balance is zero. So selecting the last element would check if the last balance is zero. But we need to ensure that all balances are zero at the end, not just the last one. Oh, that's a problem. Because if any balance is non-zero at the end, it's unbalanced.\n\nWait, the code does `all_zero = balances[0] < 0` which initializes all_zero as whether the first balance is negative. Then for each subsequent balance, it does `all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)`. Wait, that's incorrect. Because `balances[0] < 0` is a boolean sequence where each element is True if the balance is negative. Then, for each balance, it's ANDed with whether that balance is zero. But this would result in a sequence where each element is True only if all corresponding positions in balances are zero and the first balance wasn't negative. That doesn't correctly capture whether all balances are zero at the end.\n\nWait, no. The code is trying to compute whether all balances are zero at the end. So for each position, it's checking if all balances are zero. But the way it's done is by initializing all_zero as balances[0] < 0, which is a boolean sequence. Then, for each balance, it's ANDing with (balance == 0). But this would create a sequence where each element is True only if all corresponding balances are zero and the first balance wasn't negative. That's not correct because it's combining across different positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the intention was to check if, at the last position, all balances are zero. So the code should select the last element of each balance and check if they are all zero.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nall_zero = balances[0] < 0\nfor balance in balances[1:]:\n    all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\nThis is incorrect because it's combining across all positions, not just the last one. So for each position i, all_zero[i] is True only if balances[0][i] is not negative and all other balances are zero at position i. But we need to check if, at the last position, all balances are zero.\n\nSo the correct approach is to first get the last element of each balance, then check if they are all zero.\n\nSo, the code should be modified to:\n\n1. For each balance, select the last element.\n2. Check if all those last elements are zero.\n\nIn the current code, `select_last` is used on `all_zero`, which is a boolean sequence. But `all_zero` is constructed incorrectly because it's combining across all positions, not just the last.\n\nSo the main issue is in the `make_shuffle_dyck` function. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the balance for each pair.\n2. Check if any balance went negative at any position. If yes, return 0.\n3. Check if all balances are zero at the last position. If yes, return 1, else 0.\n\nIn the current code:\n\n- `any_negative` is correctly computed as whether any balance was negative at any position.\n- `has_neg` is the average of `any_negative`, which would be 1 if any position had a negative balance.\n- `all_zero` is incorrectly computed by ANDing across all balances for each position, not just the last.\n- `last_zero` is the average of `all_zero` at the last position, which is incorrect because `all_zero` is a sequence where each element is True only if all balances are zero at that position. But the way it's constructed is flawed.\n\nSo, to fix this:\n\n- Instead of constructing `all_zero` as a sequence where each element is True only if all balances are zero at that position, we should first get the last element of each balance and then check if they are all zero.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nAfter computing `balances`, for each balance, select the last element. Then, check if all those last elements are zero.\n\nSo, for each balance in balances, create a selector that selects the last element. Then, aggregate that selector on the balance to get the last value. Then, check if all those last values are zero.\n\nAlternatively, since all balances should be zero at the last position, we can create a selector that selects the last index and then check if all balances are zero there.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\n1. For each balance, create a selector that selects the last element.\n2. For each balance, aggregate using that selector to get the last value.\n3. Check if all those aggregated values are zero.\n\nBut that might be more complex. Alternatively, create a selector that selects the last index, then for each balance, check if it's zero at that position.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Create a selector that selects the last index: `select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)`\n- For each balance, aggregate using `select_last` to get the last value.\n- Then, check if all those aggregated values are zero.\n\nBut in the current code, `all_zero` is a sequence where each element is True if all balances are zero at that position. Then, `select_last` is used to get the last element of `all_zero`, which would be True only if all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nWait, but the way `all_zero` is constructed is incorrect. Because `all_zero` is initialized as `balances[0] < 0`, which is a boolean sequence where each element is True if the first balance is negative at that position. Then, for each subsequent balance, it's ANDed with whether that balance is zero at each position. So, for each position i, `all_zero[i]` is True only if the first balance is not negative at i and all other balances are zero at i. That's not correct because we need to check if all balances are zero at the last position, regardless of other positions.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- For each balance, get the last element.\n- Check if all those last elements are zero.\n\nSo, let's modify the code:\n\nAfter computing `balances`, for each balance, create a selector that selects the last index. Then, aggregate each balance using this selector to get the last value. Then, check if all those last values are zero.\n\nAlternatively, create a selector that selects the last index, then for each balance, check if it's zero at that index.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n1. Create a selector `select_last` that selects the last index.\n2. For each balance, compute whether it is zero at the last index. This can be done by aggregating the selector on the balance and checking if the result is zero.\n3. Combine all these conditions with AND to ensure all balances are zero at the last index.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nlast_zeros = []\nfor balance in balances:\n    last_balance = rasp.Aggregate(select_last, balance).named(f\"last_balance_{balance.name}\")\n    last_zero = last_balance == 0\n    last_zeros.append(last_zero)\n\n# Combine all last_zeros with AND\nall_last_zero = last_zeros[0]\nfor lz in last_zeros[1:]:\n    all_last_zero = all_last_zero & lz\n\nThen, `all_last_zero` is True only if all balances are zero at the last index.\n\nAdditionally, `any_negative` should be computed correctly. Currently, `any_negative` is a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position. Then, `has_neg` is the average of `any_negative`, which would be 1 if any position had a negative balance.\n\nBut in the code, `any_negative` is created by ORing all the individual balance < 0 conditions. However, the way it's done is by initializing `any_negative` as `balances[0] < 0` and then ORing with each subsequent balance < 0. But this is incorrect because `balances[0] < 0` is a boolean sequence, and ORing with another boolean sequence would give a sequence where each element is True if any of the corresponding elements in the balances are negative.\n\nWait, no. The code does:\n\nany_negative = balances[0] < 0\nfor balance in balances[1:]:\n    any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\nThis correctly creates a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position.\n\nThen, `has_neg` is computed as the average of `any_negative` across all positions. But since `any_negative` is a boolean sequence (1s and 0s), aggregating with select_all (which selects all elements) would compute the mean. So if any position had a negative balance, `has_neg` would be non-zero. But we need `has_neg` to be 1 if any balance was negative anywhere, else 0.\n\nWait, no. Because `any_negative` is a sequence of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates that at least one balance was negative at that position. Aggregating with select_all would average all these 1s and 0s. So if any position had a 1, the average would be greater than 0. So `has_neg` would be non-zero if any position had a negative balance.\n\nBut in the code, `has_neg` is used as a numerical value. Then, `not_has_neg` is the inverse, which would be 1 - has_neg. But if `has_neg` is non-zero, `not_has_neg` would be zero.\n\nWait, no. Because `has_neg` is the average, which could be a fraction. So if any position had a negative balance, `has_neg` would be greater than 0, making `not_has_neg` less than 1. But we need `not_has_neg` to be 1 only if no position had a negative balance.\n\nSo perhaps instead of averaging, we should check if the sum is greater than zero. But in RASP, we can't use sum directly. Alternatively, we can use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values and then check if it's greater than zero.\n\nWait, but `any_negative` is a boolean sequence. To check if any element is True, we can compute the maximum. If the maximum is 1, then there was at least one negative balance.\n\nBut RASP doesn't have a max function. Alternatively, we can compute the sum and check if it's greater than zero. But again, without a sum function, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the current approach is acceptable because if any position has a negative balance, `any_negative` will have a 1 in that position, and the average will be non-zero. So `has_neg` will be non-zero, and `not_has_neg` will be zero. But in the code, `not_has_neg` is computed as `~has_neg`, which for numerical values would invert the bits, which is not the intended behavior.\n\nWait, no. Because `has_neg` is a numerical SOp. The `~` operator is for selectors, not numerical values. So using `~has_neg` would not give the correct result. Instead, we should compute `not_has_neg` as 1 - `has_neg` being non-zero. But since `has_neg` is a float, we can't directly compute this in RASP.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because in RASP, we can't directly compute logical NOT on a numerical value. So perhaps the approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of using numerical operations, keep `any_negative` as a boolean sequence. Then, compute whether any element is True. This can be done by using SelectorWidth on `any_negative` and checking if the count is greater than zero.\n\nWait, but SelectorWidth gives the count of True values per row, which in this case is per position. Wait, no. `any_negative` is a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position. So the SelectorWidth of `any_negative` would be the number of positions where any balance was negative. If this count is greater than zero, then `has_neg` is True.\n\nBut how to compute this in RASP.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncount_negative = rasp.SelectorWidth(rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE) & any_negative)\n\nBut that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, create a selector that is True for all positions where any_negative is True. Then, the SelectorWidth of this selector would be the count of such positions. If this count is greater than zero, then `has_neg` is True.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly compare counts. So perhaps the initial approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not use numerical operations but stick to boolean operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that `has_neg` is being treated as a numerical value, but it should be a boolean indicating whether any balance was negative.\n\nSo, to fix this, instead of aggregating `any_negative` numerically, we should compute whether any element in `any_negative` is True.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, create a selector that is True for all positions where any_negative is True. Then, the SelectorWidth of this selector would be the count of such positions. If this count is greater than zero, then `has_neg` is True.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly compare counts. So perhaps we can use the fact that if any_negative has any True values, then the maximum value in any_negative is True.\n\nBut without a max function, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be restructured to avoid using numerical operations for boolean checks.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nThe goal is to compute two conditions:\n\n1. No balance went negative at any position.\n2. All balances are zero at the last position.\n\nIf both conditions are met, return 1; else, return 0.\n\nSo, for condition 1: any_negative should be all False. So, the count of True in any_negative should be zero.\n\nFor condition 2: all balances must be zero at the last position.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Compute any_negative as before.\n- Compute count_negative = SelectorWidth(any_negative). If count_negative > 0, condition 1 is violated.\n- Compute all_last_zero as before: for each balance, check if it's zero at the last position, then AND all those conditions.\n\nBut how to compute count_negative > 0 in RASP.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncount_negative = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative)\ncondition1 = count_negative == 0\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly compare numerical values like that. So perhaps we need to create a boolean sequence where each element is True if count_negative is zero.\n\nWait, but count_negative is a numerical sequence with one element (the count). So, perhaps:\n\ncondition1 = (count_negative == 0).named(\"condition1\")\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be restructured to avoid numerical operations for boolean checks.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is flawed because it's trying to use numerical operations where boolean operations are needed.\n\nLet me try to restructure the code:\n\n1. Compute any_negative as a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position.\n\n2. Compute condition1 as whether any_negative has any True values. This can be done by creating a selector that is True for all positions where any_negative is True, then using SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than zero, condition1 is False.\n\nBut again, without a way to compare counts, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the fact that if any_negative has any True values, then the maximum value in any_negative is True. But without a max function, this isn't directly possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable, but the way `not_has_neg` is computed is incorrect. Because `has_neg` is a numerical value, using `~has_neg` would not give the correct boolean result.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of using `~has_neg`, we should compute `not_has_neg` as 1 - (has_neg > 0). But again, without a way to compute this in RASP, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should avoid using numerical operations for boolean checks and instead use boolean operations throughout.\n\nLet me try to restructure the code:\n\nAfter computing `any_negative` as a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position, we can compute `has_neg` as whether any element in `any_negative` is True. This can be done by creating a selector that is True for all positions where `any_negative` is True, then using SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If this count is greater than zero, `has_neg` is True.\n\nBut again, without a way to compare counts, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the fact that if any_negative has any True values, then the sum of any_negative is greater than zero. But without a sum function, this isn't directly possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable, but the way `not_has_neg` is computed is incorrect.

RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
