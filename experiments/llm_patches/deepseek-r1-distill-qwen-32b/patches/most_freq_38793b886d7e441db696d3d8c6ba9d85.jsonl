This allows computing the histogram of any provided sequence, not just `rasp.tokens`.\n\n2. **make_sort()**:\n   - Changed the keys adjustment to add a small fraction based on the index (`i / max_seq_len`) to ensure uniqueness without disrupting the original order. This replaces the previous scaling approach which could misorder values.\n\n3. **make_sort_freq()**:\n   - Corrected the function signature to accept `vals` and `keys` parameters, aligning it with `make_sort()`. This makes the function more flexible and corrects the example usage.\n   - Uses `make_hist(keys)` to compute the frequency of each key correctly.\n\nThese changes ensure that the functions handle parameters correctly, maintain the intended functionality, and produce accurate results for sorting and frequency-based operations.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP programs. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to count how many times each token occurs. The current code uses Select with EQ on tokens, then takes the SelectorWidth. Wait, but Select creates a matrix where each row corresponds to a token, and each element is True if the token matches another. So SelectorWidth would count how many times each token appears in the entire sequence. That seems correct. But wait, in the example, for \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1], which matches the counts. So maybe make_hist() is okay. But I should double-check.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It sorts vals based on keys. It uses Select with LT on keys to get a 'smaller' selector. Then SelectorWidth gives the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. Then it creates sel_new by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals with sel_new. Hmm, but wait, when keys are unique, each key will have a unique position. So for each position i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than keys[i]. Then sel_new selects the i-th position in vals, which should be the correct sorted order. That makes sense. But what if there are ties in keys? The function says it only supports unique keys, so that's fine.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them to be unique. It uses SequenceMap to modify keys by dividing by min_key and multiplying by indices divided by max_seq_len. Wait, but if min_key is 1, and max_seq_len is 5, then for each key x and index i, the new key is x * i /5. But wait, if x is the same across different indices, this will make them unique because i is different. That should work. But in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after adjustment, they become unique, allowing make_sort_unique to sort them correctly. So that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the function is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. It uses make_hist() to get the counts, then negates them to sort in descending order. Then it calls make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the current code in make_sort_freq() has a problem. The function signature shows it takes max_seq_len as an argument, but in the example, it's called with three arguments, which doesn't match. Oh, looking at the code, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp, but in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which is incorrect. So the function should probably take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut this function only takes max_seq_len as an argument, but in the example, it's called with three arguments. That's a problem. Also, the function should take vals and keys as inputs, similar to make_sort. So the function signature is incorrect.\n\nMoreover, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(), which would invert the counts so that higher frequencies become lower, but when passed to make_sort, which sorts based on keys in ascending order, this would sort from least frequent to most frequent. Wait, no, because make_sort sorts based on keys in ascending order, so higher keys come later. So if hist is negative, higher frequencies (larger hist values) become more negative, which would be considered smaller, so they would come first. Wait, no, because if hist is -count, then higher counts become more negative, which are smaller, so they would be sorted earlier. So the sorted order would be from most frequent to least frequent. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency descending. So that seems correct.\n\nBut the function signature is wrong. It should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort. So I need to adjust that.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort(), the keys are modified using SequenceMap with lambda x, i: x / min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if min_key is 1, and max_seq_len is 5, then for each key x and index i, the new key is x * i /5. But wait, if x is the same across different i's, this will make the keys unique because i varies. That should work.\n\nWait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after adjustment, they become 2*0/5=0, 4*1/5=0.8, 3*2/5=1.2, 1*3/5=0.6. Wait, but indices start at 0? Or 1? Because in RASP, indices usually start at 0. So the adjusted keys would be 0, 0.8, 1.2, 0.6. Then when sorted, the order would be 0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, which corresponds to the original indices 0,3,1,2. So the sorted vals would be [2,1,4,3], which is not correct. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the adjustment is incorrect. Because the way keys are adjusted, the index is multiplied, which might not correctly order the keys. Maybe the adjustment should be to add a small epsilon based on the index to break ties, rather than scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the adjustment should be to create a unique key by combining the original key and the index in a way that preserves the original order for ties.\n\nWait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the adjusted keys become 2*0/5=0, 4*1/5=0.8, 3*2/5=1.2, 1*3/5=0.6. So the order of adjusted keys is 0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, which corresponds to indices 0,3,1,2. So the sorted order would be vals[0], vals[3], vals[1], vals[2], which is [2,1,4,3]. But the expected output is [1,2,3,4]. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The adjustment is incorrect. Instead of scaling the key by the index, perhaps we should add a small value based on the index to ensure uniqueness without affecting the original order. For example, add i / max_seq_len to the key. So the new key would be x + i / max_seq_len. This way, for the same x, higher i would result in a slightly higher key, preserving the original order.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the keys adjustment should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nThis way, for each key x at position i, we add a small fraction based on i, ensuring that all keys are unique. Then, when sorted, the original order is preserved for ties.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), the function is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. The current code uses hist = -1 * make_hist(), which inverts the counts. Then, when passed to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the most frequent tokens (with higher counts, thus more negative hist values) would come first. That seems correct.\n\nBut the function signature for make_sort_freq() is wrong. It should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort. So the function should be defined as def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut this function only takes max_seq_len as an argument, but in the example, it's called with three arguments. So that's incorrect. It should take vals and keys as parameters.\n\nSo, to fix make_sort_freq(), the function should be modified to accept vals and keys, compute the histogram of keys, negate it, and then sort vals based on the negated histogram counts.\n\nPutting it all together, the repairs needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), change the keys adjustment to add i / max_seq_len instead of scaling.\n\n2. Fix the function signature of make_sort_freq() to accept vals and keys, and adjust the code accordingly.\n\n3. Ensure that all functions correctly handle the parameters and that the logic aligns with the intended behavior.\n\nLet me outline the changes step by step.\n\nFor make_sort():\n\n- The current adjustment scales the key by x / min_key * i / max_seq_len. This is incorrect because it can mess up the ordering. Instead, we should add a small value to the key based on the index to break ties without affecting the original order.\n\nSo, replace the SequenceMap line with:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nThis ensures that for the same x, higher indices have slightly higher keys, preserving their order.\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n\n- The function should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort.\n\n- The current code uses rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys, but this is incorrect because the function should be general.\n\nSo, the function should be rewritten to:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist(keys).named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but make_hist() currently takes no arguments and uses rasp.tokens. That's another issue. The make_hist() function should be modified to take keys as an argument so that it can compute the histogram of the given keys.\n\nSo, make_hist() should be changed to:\n\ndef make_hist(keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nThis way, it computes the histogram of the provided keys instead of always using rasp.tokens.\n\nPutting it all together, the repaired code would involve:\n\n- Modifying make_hist() to accept keys.\n\n- Adjusting make_sort() to correctly break ties by adding index-based fractions.\n\n- Fixing make_sort_freq() to accept vals and keys, and use the correct keys for histogram.\n\nLet me write out the corrected code with these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3409, "total_tokens": 8032}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
