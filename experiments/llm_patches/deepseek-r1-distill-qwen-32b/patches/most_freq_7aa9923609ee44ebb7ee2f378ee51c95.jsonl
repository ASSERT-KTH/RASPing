Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). The function uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LEQ. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal to. So same_tok would be True where keys are <= queries. But for counting occurrences, we actually want to select when tokens are equal. So using EQ instead of LEQ makes more sense. That's probably a bug because LEQ would include more elements than intended, leading to incorrect counts.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses Select with LT to find smaller keys. Then SelectorWidth gives the count of True values, which represents how many elements are less than the current key. But when aggregating, sel_new is created by comparing target_pos (which is the count) with indices using EQ. Wait, target_pos is a sequence of counts, and indices are the positions. So for each position i, sel_new selects where target_pos equals i. But target_pos might not cover all indices, especially if there are duplicates. This could cause incorrect mapping, leading to wrong sorted positions. Maybe the approach to map target_pos to indices isn't handling duplicates correctly.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it adjusts keys by adding a small value based on indices to make them unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But if make_sort_unique isn't correctly handling the adjusted keys, the sorting might not work as intended, especially with duplicates.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), it calculates the histogram and then sorts tokens by frequency. But if make_hist() is incorrect, this function will also be wrong. Also, the way it's using negative hist might not correctly sort frequencies in descending order.\n\nSo, the main issues seem to be:\n\n1. make_hist() uses LEQ instead of EQ, leading to incorrect counts.\n2. make_sort_unique() might not correctly map the target positions, especially with duplicates.\n3. The use of Aggregate in make_sort_unique() might not be correctly assigning the values.\n\nLet me think about how to fix make_hist() first. Changing the predicate from LEQ to EQ should fix the counting.\n\nFor make_sort_unique(), perhaps the approach of using target_pos and indices isn't correct. Instead, maybe we should create a selector that for each position, selects all elements where the key is less than the current key, then use the width to determine the new position. But I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the current method isn't correctly assigning the values because when there are ties, the target_pos might not cover all necessary positions.\n\nWait, in make_sort_unique(), the idea is to sort the values based on keys. For each element, count how many keys are less than the current key. That count gives the position where the current element should be placed. So, for example, if an element has two keys less than it, it should be placed at position 2.\n\nBut when using SelectorWidth, it gives for each element the number of True values in the row, which is the count of keys less than it. Then, sel_new is trying to create a selector where for each row i, it selects the position equal to the count. But I think the way it's done might not correctly map because target_pos is a sequence of counts, and we're comparing it with indices. Maybe instead, we should create a selector where each row i has a True at position equal to the count, and then aggregate to pick the value at that position.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code in make_sort_unique() is trying to create a selector where each row i has a True at position equal to the count of smaller keys. Then, when aggregating, it picks the value at that position. But if two elements have the same count, their target positions would be the same, leading to overwriting.\n\nHmm, maybe the approach needs to be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the current code is correct, but the way it's used in make_sort() with adjusted keys is causing issues.\n\nAnother thought: in make_sort_unique(), the Aggregate is using sel_new and vals. So for each position i, it's selecting the value at position equal to the count of smaller keys. But if two elements have the same count, they would both try to select the same position, leading to incorrect aggregation. So perhaps this approach doesn't handle duplicates correctly, which is why the original code might have issues.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to handle unique keys. So maybe the problem is elsewhere. Let me check the example given. For [2,4,3,1], the sorted output should be [1,2,3,4]. Let's see:\n\nkeys = [2,4,3,1]\nsmaller = Select(keys, keys, LT) would create a selector where each row i has True for j where keys[j] < keys[i].\n\nSo for i=0 (key=2), j=3 (key=1) is True. So row 0 has one True.\ni=1 (key=4), j=0,2,3 are True. So row 1 has three Trues.\ni=2 (key=3), j=0,3 are True. So row 2 has two Trues.\ni=3 (key=1), no j has key < 1. So row 3 has zero Trues.\n\nSelectorWidth(smaller) would give [1,3,2,0]. Then, sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. For each i, we select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, no. target_pos is a sequence where each element is the count for that position. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then, for each i in 0..3, sel_new is a selector where for row i, column j is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo for i=0: j=3 (target_pos[3]=0) \u2192 True.\ni=1: j=0 (target_pos[0]=1) \u2192 True.\ni=2: j=2 (target_pos[2]=2) \u2192 True.\ni=3: j=1 (target_pos[1]=3) \u2192 True.\n\nSo sel_new would be a selector where:\nRow 0: [False, False, False, True]\nRow 1: [True, False, False, False]\nRow 2: [False, False, True, False]\nRow 3: [False, True, False, False]\n\nThen, Aggregate(sel_new, vals) would, for each row i, average the vals where selector is True. Since each row has only one True, it picks the corresponding val.\n\nSo for row 0: val[3] =1\nrow1: val[0]=2\nrow2: val[2]=3\nrow3: val[1]=4\n\nSo the output would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, target_pos is named \"target_pos\", and then sel_new is created as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). But rasp.indices is the position index, which for a sequence of length 4 is [0,1,2,3]. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0], and rasp.indices is [0,1,2,3]. So for each i in 0..3, sel_new's row i is True where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So why is the function not working as intended? Maybe the issue is elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking back at the code, in make_sort_unique(), the return is rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). But in the example, when we call make_sort_unique(vals, keys), it returns the sorted vals. So perhaps the code is correct, but the issue is in make_sort().\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the keys are adjusted by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x at position i, the new key is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that even if two keys are the same, their adjusted keys are unique because of the added term based on index. Then, make_sort_unique is called with these adjusted keys.\n\nBut in make_sort_freq(), the code is using make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\"). Wait, but make_sort expects vals and keys, but in make_sort_freq(), it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. hist is the negative frequency count. So the sorting is done based on the frequency, and for tokens with the same frequency, their adjusted keys (using indices) ensure they are ordered based on their position.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the code is written as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but make_sort expects vals and keys, but here it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. So the function is sorting the tokens based on their frequency (hist), which is correct. But the issue is that make_sort() is expecting vals and keys, but in this case, vals are the tokens, and keys are the frequencies. So when sorted, the tokens are ordered by their frequency, and for ties, their original positions are considered.\n\nBut wait, the function signature of make_sort is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp. So in make_sort_freq(), it's calling make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But make_sort expects vals and keys, so that's correct.\n\nBut looking back, in the original code, make_sort_freq() is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but make_sort expects vals and keys, but here, vals is rasp.tokens, and keys is hist. So when make_sort is called, it's using hist as the keys, which are the negative frequencies. So the sorting is done in ascending order of keys, which are negative frequencies. So higher frequencies (more negative) come first, which is correct for sorting by frequency descending.\n\nBut wait, in the example given in the comment:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n>> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\nWait, but the function signature of make_sort_freq() in the original code is def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp, but in the example, it's called with three arguments: make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That's a problem because the function only accepts one argument. So that's a bug. The function should probably accept vals and keys, but in the original code, it's only taking max_seq_len.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, the example shows make_sort_freq being called with three arguments, but the function only takes one. That's a clear error. So the function signature is incorrect. It should probably accept vals and keys, similar to make_sort_unique.\n\nSo, the function should be modified to accept vals and keys, and then compute the hist based on vals. Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their frequency, so vals are the tokens, and keys are their frequencies.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to adjust make_sort_freq() to accept vals and keys, compute the histogram of vals, then sort vals based on the frequencies.\n\nBut in the original code, make_sort_freq() is only taking max_seq_len as an argument, which is incorrect. So that's a bug.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. make_hist() uses LEQ instead of EQ, leading to incorrect counts.\n2. make_sort_freq() has an incorrect function signature, expecting only max_seq_len but being called with more arguments.\n3. The example in make_sort_freq() is incorrect, showing a call with three arguments when the function only takes one.\n\nSo, to fix these:\n\n- Change make_hist() to use EQ.\n- Fix make_sort_freq() to accept vals and keys, compute hist based on vals, then sort vals by hist, adjusting keys to ensure uniqueness.\n\nWait, but in the original code, make_sort_freq() is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. So perhaps the function should be rewritten to take vals as the tokens, compute their frequencies, then sort vals based on frequencies, using make_sort() with adjusted keys.\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort_freq() should:\n\n- Compute the histogram of vals (frequency of each token).\n- Use these frequencies as keys, but since frequencies can be the same, adjust them with indices to make them unique.\n- Sort vals based on these adjusted keys in ascending order (since higher frequency is more negative, they come first).\n\nSo, the function should be modified to:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist()(vals)\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + i / max_seq_len, hist, rasp.indices)\n    return make_sort(vals, adjusted_keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=0)\n\nWait, but make_sort() already adjusts the keys, so perhaps it's better to compute the hist, then adjust the keys by adding a small term based on indices to ensure uniqueness, then sort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should be redefined to correctly compute the frequencies and adjust the keys.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed to outline the fixes:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the predicate from LEQ to EQ.\n2. Fix make_sort_freq() to accept the correct arguments and compute the frequencies correctly.\n3. Ensure that all functions correctly use the RASP operations without relying on undefined variables.\n\nSo, the corrected code would involve these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 8719}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.LEQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
