Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select to create a selector where tokens are equal, then uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. That should give the frequency of each token. But wait, in the example, when the input is \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1]. Let me think: each token's count is correctly calculated. So make_hist seems okay.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It sorts vals based on keys using LT comparison. It creates a selector where keys are less than each other, then uses SelectorWidth to get target positions. Then it aggregates vals using a new selector. Hmm, but the way target_pos is used might be incorrect. The current code uses target_pos as the first argument to Select, but target_pos is a sequence of counts, not indices. That doesn't seem right. Oh, right, because target_pos is the count of how many keys are less than the current key. So for each position, we want to select the position where the count is >= the current index. Wait, maybe the Select is not correctly set up. Let me think: target_pos is a sequence where each element is the number of keys less than the current key. So for each position i, we want to find all j where target_pos[j] >= i. That would give the correct positions to aggregate. But the current code uses target_pos as the keys and rasp.indices as the queries. So the selector is created by comparing target_pos (keys) with indices (queries) using GEQ. So for each row i, it's checking if target_pos[j] >= i. That should correctly identify which positions j should contribute to the output at position i. Then, aggregating vals with this selector should pick the correct vals. But wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos after make_sort_unique would be [3,0,1,2], because for each key, how many are less than it. Then, for each i, we select j where target_pos[j] >= i. For i=0, all j are selected, but we need to pick the smallest key. Hmm, maybe the approach is flawed because it's not correctly ordering the keys. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach in the RASP paper uses a different method, and the current implementation is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It adjusts the keys by adding a small value based on indices to make them unique, then calls make_sort_unique. But in the example, when keys are [2,4,1,2], after adjustment, they become unique, so sorting works. However, the problem is that make_sort_unique might not be correctly implemented, which affects make_sort.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it to get frequencies, then sorts tokens based on these frequencies. But in the example, when frequencies are the same, the order should remain as in the input. However, the current code uses make_sort, which might not preserve the original order for ties. So the issue is that make_sort doesn't handle ties correctly, leading to incorrect ordering when frequencies are the same.\n\nSo the main issues are:\n\n1. make_sort_unique() might not correctly sort the values because the selector setup is incorrect. It's using target_pos as keys and indices as queries, but perhaps it should be the other way around or use a different approach.\n\n2. make_sort_freq() relies on make_sort, which in turn uses make_sort_unique. If make_sort_unique is incorrect, then the frequency sorting won't work as intended.\n\nLet me think about how to correctly implement make_sort_unique. The goal is to sort vals based on keys in ascending order. For each position i in the output, we want to select the val whose key is the i-th smallest.\n\nOne approach is to create a selector where for each row i, the selector is True for all j where key[j] is among the i-th smallest keys. Then, aggregating vals with this selector would pick the correct val.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial implementation in make_sort_unique is incorrect because it's using target_pos as keys and indices as queries. Maybe it should be the other way around. Let me try to adjust that.\n\nWait, in make_sort_unique, target_pos is the number of keys less than the current key. So for each j, target_pos[j] is the number of keys less than keys[j]. To find the position where keys[j] should be placed, we can think of it as target_pos[j] indicating how many keys are before it. So for each i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. But since multiple j's could have the same target_pos, we need to handle ties.\n\nWait, no. Because if keys are unique, target_pos will be unique for each j. So for each i from 0 to n-1, there should be exactly one j where target_pos[j] == i. Then, the selector for row i should select that j.\n\nBut in the current code, sel_new is created by comparing target_pos (keys) with indices (queries) using GEQ. So for each row i, it's selecting all j where target_pos[j] >= i. Then, when aggregating, it's taking the average of all such vals[j]. But that's not correct because we want to select the val with the smallest key, then the next, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to create a selector where for each row i, it selects the j with the i-th smallest key. To do this, we can create a selector where for each i, the j with the smallest key is selected first, then the next, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach in the RASP paper uses a different method, such as using the rank of each key and then selecting based on that.\n\nLet me think of an alternative approach. For each position i in the output, we want to select the val whose key is the i-th smallest. To find this, for each j, determine how many keys are less than keys[j]. That's target_pos[j]. Then, for each i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. But since target_pos[j] can be the same for multiple j's (in case of ties), we need to handle that.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_unique, the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so target_pos[j] should be unique for each j. So for each i, there's exactly one j where target_pos[j] == i. Therefore, the selector for row i should have True only at that j.\n\nBut in the current code, sel_new is created as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, Comparison.GEQ). So for each row i, it's checking if target_pos[j] >= i. That would include all j's where target_pos[j] is >= i. But we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo perhaps the correct selector should be where target_pos[j] == i. But how to create that.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to create a selector where for each row i, the selector is True for j where target_pos[j] == i. But how to express that in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and a better way is to create a selector that for each j, determines its rank, and then for each i, select the j with rank i.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to create a selector where for each row i, the selector is True for the j that has the i-th smallest key.\n\nTo do this, for each j, compute how many keys are less than keys[j], which is target_pos[j]. Then, for each i, the j with target_pos[j] == i is the one to select for position i.\n\nSo the selector should be such that for row i, column j is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nBut how to create such a selector in RASP.\n\nWait, perhaps using Select with EQ comparison between target_pos and a sequence that represents the row index.\n\nWait, but target_pos is a sequence of counts, and the row index is i. So for each row i, we want to select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo the selector can be created by comparing target_pos (as keys) with a sequence where each element is i (the row index). But how to get the row index into the selector.\n\nWait, perhaps using rasp.indices as the queries, but that might not directly give the row index. Alternatively, perhaps we can create a sequence where each element is the row index, which is the same as the position in the sequence.\n\nWait, but in RASP, the indices are 0-based, so for a sequence of length n, indices are [0,1,2,...,n-1].\n\nSo, to create a selector where for row i, column j is True if target_pos[j] == i, we can do:\n\nsel = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBut wait, target_pos is a sequence of integers, and rasp.indices is also a sequence of integers (0,1,2,...). So for each j, target_pos[j] is compared to the query, which is the row index i.\n\nWait, no. Because in Select, the keys are target_pos, and the queries are rasp.indices. So for each row i (which is the query), and each column j (which is the key index), the predicate is applied as keys[j] OP queries[i]. So for row i, it's checking if target_pos[j] OP i.\n\nSo if we use EQ, then for row i, column j is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the selector should be created as:\n\nsel = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThen, when we aggregate vals with this selector, for each row i, it will select the val[j] where target_pos[j] == i, which is the j with the i-th smallest key.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the current code uses:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.GEQ)\n\nWhich is incorrect because it's using GEQ instead of EQ. So the selector is including all j where target_pos[j] >= i, which is not what we want. Instead, we should use EQ.\n\nSo the correction is to change the Comparison.GEQ to Comparison.EQ in the Select call.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq, the function is named as make_sort_freq but the parameters don't match. Looking at the code:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, the function signature is def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) but in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function should take vals and keys as arguments. So the function signature is incorrect. It should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the current code, it's defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter. So that's an error. The function is missing the vals and keys parameters.\n\nSo the corrected function should accept vals and keys, and then compute the histogram based on keys, then sort vals based on the histogram frequencies.\n\nPutting it all together, the repairs needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, change the Comparison.GEQ to Comparison.EQ when creating sel_new.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, correct the function signature to include vals and keys, and adjust the parameters accordingly.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3429, "total_tokens": 8052}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.GEQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
