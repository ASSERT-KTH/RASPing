Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. Since all are True, it should return the length. But in the example, when the input is \"abcdefg\", the output is [7.0, ..., 7.0]. That seems correct. Hmm, maybe no issue here.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It uses Select with LEQ to get previous indices. Then aggregates bools. But wait, the Select uses indices as keys and queries. So for each position i, it selects all j <= i. Then Aggregate averages the bools up to i. But in the example, for \"hello\", the third element is 1/3. Let's see: positions 0,1,2. If the condition is True at position 2, then the average is 1/3. That seems correct. But wait, the code uses rasp.numerical(bools). Is that necessary? Maybe, but perhaps the issue is elsewhere.\n\nLooking at make_pair_balance(). It computes the fraction of opens and closes, then subtracts. But in the example, the output for \"a()b(c))\" is [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]. Let me check the code. It uses LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and -1. That should subtract the closes from opens. Seems correct.\n\nNow, make_shuffle_dyck(). The goal is to return 1 if all parentheses are balanced, else 0. The current code checks if any balance is negative and if the last balance is zero. But the output is a sequence where each element is 1 or 0. Wait, the example shows that for \"({)}\", the output is all 1s, but actually, the parentheses are unbalanced because '{' is not closed properly. Hmm, maybe the logic is flawed.\n\nWait, the function computes any_negative as whether any balance is negative. Then has_neg is the aggregate, which averages the any_negative across all positions. But if any position has a negative balance, has_neg would be non-zero. Then not_has_neg is the negation. But the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg). So if any balance is negative, not_has_neg is False, making the result 0. But in the example, \"({)}\" should return 0 because it's unbalanced. But according to the example, it returns [1,1,1,1]. That's incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative across all positions. But if any position has a negative balance, the average would be non-zero, making has_neg non-zero. Then not_has_neg would be False, so the result is 0. But in the example, the code returns 1, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. The code computes any_negative as the OR of all balances being negative. Then has_neg is the aggregate of any_negative across all positions. But if any position has any_negative as True (1), then the average would be >= 1/(length). So has_neg would be non-zero. Then not_has_neg is ~has_neg, which would be False if has_neg is non-zero. So the final result is last_zero & not_has_neg. If any_negative is True, not_has_neg is False, so the result is False (0). But in the example, the code returns 1, which suggests that the logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is using Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative across all positions. But any_negative is already a sequence where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. So the aggregate would be the average of 1s and 0s across all positions. But we need to check if any position has a negative balance. So if any element in any_negative is 1, then has_neg should be 1. But the current code uses Aggregate, which would return a value between 0 and 1, not a binary 1 if any is True.\n\nSo the problem is that has_neg is not correctly indicating whether any position had a negative balance. Instead, it's the average, which isn't binary. So the condition (last_zero & not_has_neg) isn't correctly capturing the requirement.\n\nTo fix this, we need has_neg to be 1 if any position has a negative balance, else 0. So instead of using Aggregate, which averages, we should check if any element in any_negative is non-zero.\n\nBut how can we do that in RASP? We can create a selector that checks if any_negative is non-zero and then use SelectorWidth or another method to get a binary result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector. Wait, any_negative is an SOp of 1s and 0s. So SelectorWidth would count the number of 1s. If the count is greater than 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nWait, but SelectorWidth is for selectors, not SOps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a selector where any_negative is True, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code:\n\nInstead of aggregating any_negative, we can create a selector where any_negative is True, then use SelectorWidth to get the count. If the count is greater than 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to convert the any_negative SOp into a selector. Maybe using Select with a predicate that is always True, but only when any_negative is True.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a Select operation where the keys are any_negative and the queries are a constant True, using EQ as the predicate. Then, the selector will have True where any_negative is True.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nselect_any_negative = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: True, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThen, selector_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\n\nIf selector_width is greater than 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly compare selector_width to 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the SelectorWidth and then Map to convert it into a binary value.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nhas_neg = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, has_neg)\n\nBut in RASP, we can't use > directly. So perhaps:\n\nhas_neg = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\nhas_neg = rasp.numerical(has_neg)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1 if x > 0 else 0, has_neg)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate to average any_negative, which is not the correct way to check if any balance is negative. Instead, we should check if any element in any_negative is non-zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to create a selector that is True where any_negative is non-zero, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code:\n\nFirst, create a selector where any_negative is non-zero.\n\nselect_any_negative = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: 1, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nThen, selector_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\n\nIf selector_width > 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the SelectorWidth and then Map to convert it into a binary value.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the SelectorWidth and then check if it's greater than zero.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly compare the width to zero. So perhaps we can create a selector where the width is greater than zero and then use SelectorWidth again.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nwidth = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\nwidth = rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, width)\nhas_neg = width\n\nBut again, in RASP, the Map function applies element-wise, so this would convert the width into a boolean indicating if any element was True.\n\nWait, but the width is a sequence where each element is the count of True values in each row. So if any row has a count >0, then the corresponding element in width would be True.\n\nWait, no. The width is a sequence where each element is the count of True values in each row of the selector. So if any selector row has at least one True, the corresponding width element is >=1.\n\nSo, if we create a selector where any_negative is non-zero, then the width would be the number of positions where any_negative is non-zero. If that width is >0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate, which is incorrect. Instead, we should use SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector.\n\nWait, any_negative is an SOp of 1s and 0s. So, to check if any element is 1, we can create a selector where each element is True if any_negative is 1.\n\nSo:\n\nselect_any_negative = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: 1, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThen, selector_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\n\nIf selector_width is greater than 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the SelectorWidth and then Map to convert it into a binary value.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the SelectorWidth and then check if it's greater than zero.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly compare the width to zero. So perhaps we can create a selector where the width is greater than zero and then use SelectorWidth again.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nwidth = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative)\nwidth = rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, width)\nhas_neg = width\n\nBut then, has_neg would be a sequence of booleans indicating if any position had a negative balance.\n\nBut in the code, has_neg is used in the final condition. So perhaps we need to adjust the code to correctly compute has_neg as a binary value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative across all positions. But we need to check if any position has any_negative as True. So instead of averaging, we should check if any element is True.\n\nBut in RASP, the only way to do this is to create a selector where any_negative is True and then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code:\n\nInstead of:\n\nselect_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\"select_all\")\nhas_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\"has_neg\")\n\nWe should do:\n\nselect_any = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: 1, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.NEQ).named(\"select_any\")\nhas_neg = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any).named(\"has_neg\")\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, has_neg).named(\"has_neg_bool\")\n\nWait, but SelectorWidth returns the count per row. So if any_negative has any True, the count would be >=1. So the Map would convert it to True.\n\nBut then, has_neg is a sequence of booleans. We need to aggregate this into a single value indicating if any position had a negative balance.\n\nWait, perhaps we can create a selector that is True if any position has a negative balance, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is >0, then has_neg is True.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector and then check if it's greater than zero.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative across all positions. But we need to check if any position has any_negative as True. So instead of averaging, we should check if any element is True.\n\nBut in RASP, the only way to do this is to create a selector where any_negative is True and then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code:\n\nselect_any_negative = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: 1, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.NEQ).named(\"select_any_negative\")\nselector_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative).named(\"selector_width\")\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, selector_width).named(\"has_neg\")\n\nBut then, has_neg is a sequence where each element is True if any_negative was True at that position. Wait, no. The selector_width is a sequence where each element is the count of True values in each row of select_any_negative. So if any_negative has any True in any row, the count would be >=1.\n\nWait, but select_any_negative is a selector where each row corresponds to a position, and each element in the row is True if any_negative at that position is True. So the selector_width would be a sequence where each element is 1 if any_negative was True at that position, else 0.\n\nWait, no. The selector_width is the number of True values in each row. So if any_negative is True at position i, then the selector's row i has all elements True where any_negative[i] is True. Wait, no, the selector is created with keys as any_negative and queries as a constant 1, using NEQ. So for each position i, the selector will have True where any_negative[i] != 1. Wait, no, the predicate is NEQ, so it's True when key != query. So if any_negative[i] is 1, then key != query is False, so the selector's row i will have all False. If any_negative[i] is 0, then key != query is True, so the selector's row i will have all True.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what we want. We want the selector to be True where any_negative is True (i.e., 1). So perhaps the predicate should be EQ.\n\nWait, let me think again. any_negative is an SOp that is 1 where any balance is negative. So for each position i, any_negative[i] is 1 if any balance is negative at i.\n\nWe want to create a selector where row i has True in all positions where any_negative[i] is 1. So for each i, if any_negative[i] is 1, then the selector's row i is all True.\n\nSo, the selector can be created as:\n\nselect_any_negative = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: 1, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_any_negative\")\n\nThen, selector_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any_negative).named(\"selector_width\")\n\nThis will give a sequence where each element is the number of True values in each row of select_any_negative. If any_negative[i] is 1, then the row i has all True, so selector_width[i] is the length of the sequence. If any_negative[i] is 0, then the row i has all False, so selector_width[i] is 0.\n\nWait, no. Because the selector is created with keys as any_negative and queries as 1, using EQ. So for each i, j, the selector[i][j] is True if any_negative[i] == 1. So for each row i, if any_negative[i] is 1, then all elements in row i are True. So the selector_width[i] would be the length of the sequence. If any_negative[i] is 0, then all elements in row i are False, so selector_width[i] is 0.\n\nBut we only need to know if any_negative is True at any position. So if any selector_width[i] > 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a selector that is True if any_negative is True at any position, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values across all rows.\n\nWait, but that's not directly possible. Alternatively, perhaps we can create a selector where each row is True if any_negative is True at that position, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True rows.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector and then check if the sum is greater than zero.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't sum across all elements. So perhaps we can create a selector that is True if any_negative is True at any position, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row, and then check if any of those counts are greater than zero.\n\nWait, but that's similar to what I tried before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate, which is incorrect. Instead, we should use SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector.\n\nWait, any_negative is an SOp of 1s and 0s. So, to check if any element is 1, we can create a selector where each row i has True in all positions if any_negative[i] is 1.\n\nThen, the selector_width would be the length of the sequence if any_negative[i] is 1, else 0.\n\nThen, if any selector_width[i] > 0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector and then check if the maximum value is greater than zero.\n\nBut RASP doesn't have a max function.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate, which is incorrect. Instead, we should use SelectorWidth on the any_negative selector.\n\nWait, let me think again. The current code computes any_negative as the OR of all balances being negative. Then, has_neg is the average of any_negative across all positions. But we need has_neg to be 1 if any position has any_negative as True, else 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to create a selector where any_negative is True, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. If any row has a count >0, then has_neg is True.\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a selector where any_negative is True, then use SelectorWidth to get the count per row. Then, use another selector to check if any count is >0.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages the any_negative across all positions. But we need to check if any position has any_negative as True. So instead of"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] >= 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
