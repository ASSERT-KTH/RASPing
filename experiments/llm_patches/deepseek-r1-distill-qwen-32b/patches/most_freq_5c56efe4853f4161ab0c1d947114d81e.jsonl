Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select to create a selector where tokens are equal, then uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. That should give the frequency of each token. But wait, in the example, when the input is \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1]. Let me think: each token's count is correctly calculated. So maybe make_hist() is okay, but perhaps there's an issue with how it's used elsewhere.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. It creates a selector where keys are less than each other, then uses SelectorWidth to get target positions. Then it aggregates vals based on these positions. Hmm, but when I look at the code, the target_pos is the count of how many keys are less than the current key. That should give the correct position for each element. But wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output should be [1,2,3,4]. Let me see: the target_pos would be [3,0,1,2], because for each position, it's counting how many keys are less than it. Then, when aggregating, each position i would take the value from the position where target_pos equals i. That seems correct. But maybe there's an issue with how the selector is used.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them with indices. The keys are modified using a SequenceMap that adds min_key * i ^ max_seq_len. Wait, the operator here is a bitwise XOR, but maybe it should be multiplication. Because adding min_key multiplied by the index would ensure uniqueness based on position. Using XOR might not give the intended unique keys. So that's probably a bug. I should change the lambda to x + min_key * i * max_seq_len or something similar to ensure uniqueness.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq() uses make_sort with hist as keys. But hist is the frequency count, and it's negated. Wait, in the example, when the input is [2,4,2,1], the frequencies are [2,1,2,1]. So hist would be [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, make_sort is called with these as keys. But since the keys are negative, the sort would order them from smallest to largest, which would be -2, -2, -1, -1. That would sort the tokens in the order of most frequent first. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. However, the way keys are adjusted in make_sort might not be correct because of the XOR operator. Also, the min_key is set to 1, but perhaps it should be a smaller value to ensure proper ordering when frequencies are the same.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) but in the example usage, it's called with three arguments, which doesn't match. Oh, looking back, the user provided code has make_sort_freq with parameters (vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int), but in the code, it's defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int). That's a discrepancy. So the function signature is incorrect. It should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort_unique.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq, the line return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1) is using rasp.tokens as vals, but perhaps it should be using the input vals instead. Wait, no, the function is supposed to sort the tokens based on their frequency, so using rasp.tokens as vals is correct. But the function signature is wrong because it's missing the vals and keys parameters.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's code has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut the example usage shows:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) >> [2,2,4,1]\n\nWhich suggests that make_sort_freq expects three arguments: vals, keys, max_seq_len. But the current definition only takes max_seq_len. So that's a bug. The function should be modified to accept vals and keys as parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, the issues I found are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the lambda uses x + min_key * i ^ max_seq_len, which uses XOR. It should probably be multiplication instead to ensure unique keys. So change it to x + min_key * i * max_seq_len or similar.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the function signature is incorrect. It should take vals and keys as arguments, not just max_seq_len.\n\n3. Also, in make_sort_freq(), the line return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...) should use the input vals instead of rasp.tokens if the function is supposed to sort arbitrary vals based on the frequency of keys. Or perhaps the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their own frequency, so using rasp.tokens is correct. But the function signature needs to match the example usage.\n\nWait, the example usage for make_sort_freq is:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) >> [2,2,4,1]\n\nWhich suggests that make_sort_freq is called with three arguments: vals, keys, max_seq_len. So the function should be defined as def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the current code, it's defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int):, which is incorrect. So I need to adjust the function signature.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq, the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(), which is correct because we want to sort in descending order of frequency. But when calling make_sort, the keys are hist, which are negative frequencies. So the sort will arrange them from smallest (most negative) to largest, which corresponds to highest frequency first.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the keys are modified to ensure uniqueness. The current code uses x + min_key * i ^ max_seq_len. Using XOR might not be the best approach. Instead, perhaps adding min_key multiplied by the index would be better to ensure uniqueness. So I'll change that.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1, but perhaps it should be a smaller value, like 0.1, to ensure that the index-based adjustment doesn't interfere with the frequency values too much.\n\nWait, but in the example, when frequencies are the same, the tokens should appear in the same order as in the input. So the adjustment using indices should ensure that when frequencies are equal, the token with the lower index comes first. So the keys after adjustment would be frequency + min_key * index. That way, when frequencies are the same, the token with the smaller index has a slightly smaller key, so it comes first in the sorted order.\n\nWait, no. Because in the make_sort function, the keys are modified as x + min_key * i ^ max_seq_len. If we change it to x + min_key * i * max_seq_len, then for each position i, the key is adjusted by min_key * i * max_seq_len, which would make each key unique based on their position. That should help in breaking ties correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize the changes needed:\n\n1. In make_sort(), change the lambda in SequenceMap from x + min_key * i ^ max_seq_len to x + min_key * i * max_seq_len.\n\n2. Fix the function signature of make_sort_freq() to accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n3. In make_sort_freq(), ensure that the vals and keys are correctly passed to make_sort(). Currently, it's using rasp.tokens as vals, but if the function is supposed to sort arbitrary vals based on keys' frequencies, then perhaps vals should be passed as the first argument. Alternatively, if it's intended to sort the tokens based on their own frequencies, then using rasp.tokens is correct. But the function signature needs to match the example.\n\nWait, looking back, the example for make_sort_freq is:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) >> [2,2,4,1]\n\nSo the function is called with vals=rasp.tokens, keys=rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5. So the function should be defined as def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the current code, it's defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int):, which is incorrect. So I need to adjust that.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq(), the line return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...) should use the input vals instead of rasp.tokens if the function is supposed to sort the given vals. Wait, no, because the function is named make_sort_freq, which suggests it's sorting based on frequency. So perhaps the vals are the tokens, and the keys are their frequencies. So the current code is correct in using rasp.tokens as vals, but the function signature is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should accept vals and keys, compute the frequency of keys, and sort vals based on that. So the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist(keys).named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, make_hist() currently takes no arguments and uses rasp.tokens. So if we want to compute the frequency of keys, we need to pass keys to make_hist(). So perhaps make_hist() should be modified to accept an SOp as input. Alternatively, in make_sort_freq, we can compute the frequency of the keys.\n\nWait, looking back, the current make_hist() function is:\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nSo it's using rasp.tokens. If we want to compute the frequency of another sequence, say keys, then make_hist() should take keys as input. So perhaps make_hist() should be modified to accept an SOp parameter.\n\nAlternatively, in make_sort_freq(), we can create a selector based on the keys instead of tokens. So perhaps the code should be:\n\nsame_tok = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\nhist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nBut in the current code, make_hist() is hardcoded to use rasp.tokens. So to make it general, make_hist() should take an SOp as input.\n\nSo, to fix this, I'll modify make_hist() to accept an SOp parameter.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Modify make_hist() to take an optional SOp parameter, defaulting to rasp.tokens.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), compute the hist based on the keys passed to it.\n\n3. Fix the function signature of make_sort_freq() to accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n4. In make_sort(), change the lambda to use multiplication instead of XOR.\n\n5. Ensure that the default for Aggregate is None, as per the rules.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n- Update make_hist():\n\ndef make_hist(sop: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(sop, sop, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n- Update make_sort_freq():\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist(keys).named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the example, make_sort_freq is called with rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. So when keys are the same as vals, it's correct. But if someone wants to sort vals based on the frequency of keys, this would work.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the keys are modified using a SequenceMap. The current code uses x + min_key * i ^ max_seq_len. I'll change it to x + min_key * i * max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo, in make_sort():\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i * max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, but min_key is a parameter, so perhaps it's better to use a small value to prevent the index adjustment from overshadowing the actual keys. Maybe min_key should be a fraction, like 0.1, but in the example, it's set to 1. Hmm, perhaps it's better to leave it as is, but ensure that the adjustment is unique.\n\nWait, another approach: to make the keys unique, we can add a small epsilon multiplied by the index. For example, keys = keys + epsilon * indices. This way, when frequencies are the same, the token with the lower index comes first.\n\nBut in the current code, the adjustment is done by adding min_key * i * max_seq_len. That might make the adjustment too large, but perhaps it's necessary to ensure uniqueness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a unique identifier for each position, like adding the index multiplied by a very small number, ensuring that the primary key is the frequency, and the secondary key is the index.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with changing the XOR to multiplication.\n\nNow, putting all the changes together, the repaired code should look like this:\n\n- Modify make_hist() to accept an optional sop parameter.\n\n- Fix make_sort_freq() function signature and use the correct parameters.\n\n- Change the lambda in make_sort() to use multiplication.\n\n- Ensure that Aggregate uses default=None.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 4022, "total_tokens": 8645}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
