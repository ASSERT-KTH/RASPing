Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). It's supposed to return the length of the input sequence as an SOp. The current implementation uses SelectorWidth on a selector that's always true. That should give a sequence where each element is the total number of elements, which is correct. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the count per row, which for a square selector would be the number of True values in each row. Since all are True, each row has length elements. So SelectorWidth would return a sequence where each element is the length. That seems right. But maybe the function is correct as is. Hmm.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It counts the fraction of previous tokens where a condition was True. The code uses Select with LEQ, which includes the current index. But when calculating previous tokens, we shouldn't include the current one. So the selector should be LT instead of LEQ. That's a bug. Also, the Aggregate uses default=0, but according to the rules, Aggregate should have default=None. So that's another issue.\n\nMoving on to make_pair_balance(). It computes the difference between the fraction of open and close tokens. The function calls make_frac_prevs for both open and close. But make_frac_prevs includes the current token because of the LEQ issue. So it's counting the current token as a previous, which is incorrect. Also, the LinearSequenceMap uses 1 and -1, but if the fractions include the current token, it might affect the balance incorrectly. So the main issue here is the same as in make_frac_prevs.\n\nFinally, make_shuffle_dyck(). This function checks if all parentheses are balanced. It computes balances for each pair, checks if any are negative, and if the last balance is zero. But the way it aggregates might be incorrect. Also, using Map(lambda x: x) on any_negative might not be necessary. Additionally, the Select for select_last uses length - 1, but length is an SOp, and subtracting 1 might not work as intended. It should ensure that it's correctly selecting the last index.\n\nSo, the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_frac_prevs, using LEQ instead of LT in the selector, causing inclusion of the current token.\n2. Using default=0 in Aggregate, which should be default=None.\n3. In make_shuffle_dyck, the way length - 1 is used might not be correct because length is an SOp, and subtracting 1 from it as if it's an integer could cause issues. Instead, we should create an SOp that represents the last index correctly.\n\nLet me outline the repairs:\n\nFor make_frac_prevs:\n- Change the selector from LEQ to LT so that it only includes previous tokens.\n- Remove the default=0 parameter in Aggregate to adhere to the rule of using default=None.\n\nFor make_shuffle_dyck:\n- The select_last should correctly target the last element. Since length is an SOp that returns a sequence of the length, subtracting 1 from it would give the last index. But in RASP, operations are element-wise, so perhaps using rasp.Map to subtract 1 from each element of length would work. Alternatively, create a constant selector for the last index.\n\nWait, in the original code, select_last is created using rasp.indices and length - 1 with EQ comparison. But length is an SOp that returns a sequence where each element is the length. So length - 1 would be an SOp where each element is length-1. Then, Select with EQ would create a selector where each row has True only at the position equal to length-1. But since the sequence length is the same as the input, this should correctly select the last element for each position. However, when evaluating, each position's query is compared to the key, which is the indices. So for each position i, it's checking if i equals length-1. That should correctly select the last element across all positions.\n\nBut wait, when using Select with keys as indices and queries as length-1, each row corresponds to a query element. So for each query element (which is length-1 for all), it compares to each key (indices 0,1,...). So the selector will have True only in the row corresponding to the query (which is the same for all) at the column where key equals length-1. But since all queries are the same, all rows will have True only at the last column. Then, when aggregating, each row will average the last element of the SOP. So for has_neg, it's correctly getting the last element of any_negative.\n\nBut in the original code, any_negative is created by numerical(Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)). That seems redundant because any_negative is already a numerical SOP. So that Map can be removed.\n\nAlso, in make_shuffle_dyck, the function returns (last_zero & not_has_neg). But last_zero is an Aggregate which returns a sequence where each element is the average of the selected elements. Since the selector selects only the last element, each element in last_zero will be the value of all_zero at the last position. So the result is a sequence where each element is 1.0 if all balances are zero at the end, else 0.0. Similarly, has_neg is 1.0 if any balance was negative, else 0.0. So not_has_neg is 0.0 if has_neg is 1.0, and 1.0 otherwise. Then, last_zero & not_has_neg would be 1.0 only if both are 1.0, meaning all balances are zero at the end and no negatives occurred. But using & on numerical SOPs might not work as intended because it's a boolean operation. Instead, perhaps we should multiply them or use a logical AND via a Map.\n\nWait, in RASP, the & operator on selectors is for boolean operations, but here we're dealing with numerical SOPs. So the current code might not be correctly combining them. Instead, we should create a new SOP that combines the two conditions: last_zero must be True (1.0) and has_neg must be False (0.0). So the result should be 1.0 only if both conditions are met.\n\nSo, perhaps we should compute the logical AND of last_zero and not_has_neg. But since these are numerical SOPs, we can't directly use &. Instead, we can use a Map to apply a lambda function that returns 1.0 if both are 1.0, else 0.0.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the product of last_zero and not_has_neg, but that would give 1.0 only if both are 1.0. However, if last_zero is 1.0 and not_has_neg is 1.0, the product is 1.0. If either is 0.0, the product is 0.0. So that might work.\n\nBut let me think again. last_zero is an Aggregate that returns 1.0 if all_zero at the last position is True, else 0.0. has_neg is 1.0 if any balance was negative. So not_has_neg is 0.0 if has_neg is 1.0, else 1.0. So the desired result is 1.0 only if last_zero is 1.0 and not_has_neg is 1.0. So the logical AND of last_zero and not_has_neg.\n\nBut since these are numerical SOPs, perhaps we can multiply them. Because 1.0 * 1.0 = 1.0, and any other combination would be 0.0. So that would correctly represent the AND condition.\n\nSo, in make_shuffle_dyck, instead of returning (last_zero & not_has_neg), which may not work as intended, we should compute last_zero * not_has_neg.\n\nWait, but last_zero and not_has_neg are both numerical SOPs. So multiplying them would give the desired result.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and 1, but that would add them, which isn't correct. So multiplication is better.\n\nSo, the repair steps are:\n\n1. In make_frac_prevs, change the selector from LEQ to LT and remove the default parameter.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck, adjust the way last_zero and not_has_neg are combined.\n\nLet me go through each function step by step.\n\nStarting with make_frac_prevs:\n\nOriginal code:\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\nreturn rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\nChange to:\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\nreturn rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\nBecause using LT excludes the current index, and default is set to None by default, which is correct.\n\nNext, make_pair_balance:\n\nIt uses make_frac_prevs, which now correctly excludes the current token. So no changes needed here except ensuring that the fractions are correctly calculated.\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck:\n\nThe main issues are in the combination of last_zero and not_has_neg.\n\nOriginal code:\nreturn (last_zero & not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\")\n\nThis uses the & operator, which is for selectors, not numerical SOPs. So we need to change this.\n\nInstead, we can compute the product of last_zero and not_has_neg, since both are numerical SOPs that output 1.0 or 0.0.\n\nSo, replace with:\nresult = rasp.numerical(rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x * y, last_zero, not_has_neg))\nreturn result.named(\"shuffle_dyck\")\n\nAlternatively, since multiplication is commutative, we can use a LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and 1, but that's unnecessary. Using SequenceMap with multiplication is clearer.\n\nWait, but last_zero and not_has_neg are both numerical SOPs. So their element-wise product will be 1.0 only if both are 1.0.\n\nAnother approach is to use a Map that returns 1.0 if both are 1.0, else 0.0. But multiplication achieves the same result.\n\nSo, the corrected code would be:\n\nresult = rasp.numerical(rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x * y, last_zero, not_has_neg))\nreturn result.named(\"shuffle_dyck\")\n\nAdditionally, in make_shuffle_dyck, the any_negative is created with a Map that does nothing. So we can remove that Map.\n\nOriginal code:\nany_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\"any_negative\")\n\nChange to:\nany_negative = rasp.numerical(any_negative).named(\"any_negative\")\n\nBecause any_negative is already a boolean SOP, converting it to numerical is sufficient.\n\nAlso, in the select_last part:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nBut length is an SOp that returns a sequence of the length. So length - 1 is an SOp where each element is length-1. Then, Select with EQ will create a selector where each row has True only at the column equal to length-1. This should correctly select the last element for each position.\n\nWait, but when using Select with keys as indices and queries as length-1, each query is the same (length-1), so each row in the selector will have True only at the last column. Then, when aggregating, each element in the output will be the value of the SOP at the last position. So for has_neg, it's correctly getting the last element of any_negative.\n\nBut any_negative is a sequence where each element is 1.0 if any balance was negative up to that point. So the last element indicates if any balance was negative in the entire sequence. So has_neg will be 1.0 if any balance was negative, else 0.0.\n\nSimilarly, last_zero is 1.0 if all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nSo combining them via multiplication gives 1.0 only if both conditions are met.\n\nAnother thing to check is the initial assertion in make_shuffle_dyck. It asserts that len(pairs) >=1, which is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the repaired functions should:\n\n- In make_frac_prevs, use LT and remove default.\n- In make_shuffle_dyck, remove the redundant Map, and combine last_zero and not_has_neg via multiplication.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 3339, "total_tokens": 8392}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] != 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] == 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
