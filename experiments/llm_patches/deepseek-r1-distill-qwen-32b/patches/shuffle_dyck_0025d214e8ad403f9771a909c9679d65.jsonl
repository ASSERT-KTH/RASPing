Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. For a TRUE selector, each row would have all True, so the width is the length of the sequence. That makes sense. But when I look at the example, it returns a sequence where each element is the length. So that part seems correct.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It uses Select with LEQ on indices to create a selector where each row includes all previous elements. Then it aggregates the boolean values. But wait, the Aggregate function averages the selected values. So for each position, it's the sum of True (which are 1s) divided by the count. That gives the fraction. But in the example, for \"hello\", the third element is 1/3 because there's one 'l' in the first two positions. That seems correct. Hmm, maybe the issue is elsewhere.\n\nLooking at make_pair_balance(). It computes the fraction of open and close tokens and subtracts them. But when I look at the example, the output seems correct. Maybe the problem is with how the fractions are calculated. Wait, in make_frac_prevs, the bools are converted to numerical, which turns True into 1.0. Then, when aggregated, it's the average of 1s up to that point. That should be correct.\n\nNow, make_shuffle_dyck(). This function checks if all parentheses are balanced. It computes the balance for each pair, checks if any balance is negative, and if the last balance is zero. But looking at the code, the 'any_negative' is created by OR-ing all balances being negative. Then, it's converted to numerical. But when using Aggregate with select_all, it averages all the negative flags. Wait, but if any balance is negative, the average would be non-zero. But the code uses 'any_negative' as a boolean, so maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, when the input is \"({)}\", the output is all 1s, meaning it's balanced. But actually, \"({)}\" is not balanced because the parentheses don't match properly. So maybe the function isn't correctly checking all pairs.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_shuffle_dyck, the 'any_negative' is created by checking if any balance is negative. But the way it's done is by OR-ing each balance < 0. However, each balance is an SOp, and the comparison returns a Selector. Then, when converted to numerical, it's 1.0 where True. But when aggregated, it's the average of 1s across the sequence. So 'has_neg' would be 1.0 if any position has a negative balance. But the code then uses 'has_neg' as a boolean, but it's actually a numerical value. So when it's used in the final condition, it might not correctly represent whether any balance was negative.\n\nWait, in the code, 'any_negative' is created as a Selector, then converted to numerical. But when you do 'any_negative = balances[0] < 0', that's a Selector. Then, when you aggregate with select_all, which selects all elements, the average would be 1.0 if any element is True. But actually, if any element is True, the average would be at least 1/(length). So 'has_neg' would be non-zero if any balance was negative. Then, 'not_has_neg' is the inverse, which would be 0 if any balance was negative.\n\nBut in the final return, it's (last_zero & not_has_neg). So if any balance was negative, not_has_neg is 0, making the whole expression 0. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the example given, when the input is \"({)}\", the function returns [1,1,1,1], implying it's balanced, but it's actually not. So perhaps the function isn't correctly checking all pairs.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the function only checks if any balance is negative and if the last balance is zero. But it doesn't ensure that all balances are zero at the end. For example, if one pair is closed properly, but another isn't, the function might incorrectly return 1.\n\nWait, looking at the code, 'all_zero' is created by AND-ing each balance == 0. So if any balance is not zero at the end, 'all_zero' is False. Then, 'last_zero' is the aggregate of 'all_zero' at the last position. So if all balances are zero at the last position, 'last_zero' is True. Otherwise, it's False.\n\nSo the function returns 1 only if there were no negative balances and all balances are zero at the end. That should correctly identify balanced parentheses.\n\nWait, but in the example given, \"({)}\" should return 0 because the parentheses are not balanced. Let me see:\n\nFor \"({)}\", the pairs are \"()\" and \"{}\". Let's track each balance.\n\nFor \"(\", the balance for () increases by 1. For \"{\", the balance for {} increases by 1. Then, the next character is ')', which decreases the () balance by 1, making it 0. Then, '}', which decreases the {} balance by 1, making it 0. Wait, but the string is \"({)}\", which is four characters. So the balances would be:\n\nAfter '(': () balance is 1, {} balance is 0.\n\nAfter '{': () balance is 1, {} balance is 1.\n\nAfter ')': () balance is 0, {} balance is 1.\n\nAfter '}': () balance is 0, {} balance is 0.\n\nSo all balances are zero at the end, and no balance went negative. So the function would return 1, which is incorrect because the string \"({)}\" is actually unbalanced because the parentheses don't nest correctly. The function only checks the counts, not the nesting order.\n\nAh, so the issue is that the function only checks the counts, not the order. It's a known limitation of such approaches. But according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to return 1 if the parentheses are balanced, 0 otherwise. So perhaps the function is correct in terms of the counts, but the example given is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The example says that \"({)}\" returns [1,1,1,1], which implies it's balanced, but it's actually not. So the function is incorrect because it doesn't check the nesting order, only the counts.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to return 1 if the parentheses are balanced, which requires both correct counts and proper nesting. So the current implementation is incorrect because it doesn't check the nesting.\n\nHmm, but how can we fix that with RASP operations? It's more complex because we need to track the order of opening and closing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is intended to only check the counts, not the nesting. But according to the example, it's supposed to return 0 for \"(){)}\", which has an extra ')'.\n\nWait, in the example, \"({)}\" returns [1,1,1,1], but it's actually unbalanced because the parentheses are not properly nested. So the function is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the function doesn't check the nesting, only the counts. To fix this, we need a way to track the order of opening and closing.\n\nBut with RASP operations, it's challenging because we can't use loops or conditionals that depend on the data. So perhaps the function is as correct as it can be with the given constraints, but it's not a perfect solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in make_shuffle_dyck, the 'select_last' is created using 'length + 1' as the query. But 'length' is an SOp that returns the length of the sequence. So for a sequence of length 4, the indices are 0,1,2,3. So 'length + 1' would be 5, which is beyond the indices. So the selector would never select anything, making 'last_zero' always None, which defaults to 0. So the condition 'last_zero' would always be 0, making the final result 0.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me see:\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck, 'select_last' is created as:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length + 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nBut 'length' is the length of the sequence, say 4. So 'length + 1' is 5. The queries are 5, and the keys are the indices (0,1,2,3). So the selector would have True only where index ==5, which is never. So the selector is all False. Then, when aggregating, it uses the default, which is 0. So 'last_zero' is 0.\n\nBut 'last_zero' is supposed to check if all balances are zero at the last position. So the selector should select the last element. Instead, it's selecting nothing.\n\nAh, that's the bug. Instead of selecting the last index, it's trying to select index equal to length +1, which is beyond the sequence.\n\nSo to fix this, the selector should select the last index, which is length -1. Because indices are 0-based.\n\nSo in the code, 'select_last' should be created with 'length -1' as the query.\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nBut wait, 'length' is an SOp that returns a sequence where each element is the length. So when we do 'length -1', it's subtracting 1 from each element, which would give the last index.\n\nWait, but in RASP, operations are element-wise. So 'length' is a sequence where each element is the length of the input. So 'length -1' would be a sequence where each element is (length -1). So when used as the query in Select, it's comparing each index to (length -1), which is the last index.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the selector would have True only in the last row, for the last element.\n\nSo the bug is that in make_shuffle_dyck, the select_last is using length +1 instead of length -1. That's why it's not selecting the last element, leading to incorrect results.\n\nSo to fix it, I need to change 'length +1' to 'length -1' in the Select operation for select_last.\n\nLet me update that line.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_frac_prevs, the Select uses LEQ on indices. So for each position i, it includes all j <= i. But when aggregated, it's the average of the booleans up to i. That gives the fraction of True up to that point. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, for \"hello\", the third element is 1/3. Let's see:\n\nIndices are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor position 2 (third element), the selector includes indices 0,1,2.\n\nIf the condition is whether the token is 'l', then in \"hello\", the tokens are 'h','e','l','l','o'.\n\nSo for position 2, the previous tokens are 'h','e','l'. So one 'l' out of three, giving 1/3. That's correct.\n\nSo the make_frac_prevs seems correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_pair_balance, the function returns the difference between opens and closes. But in the example, the output is [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 2/5]. Wait, let me check:\n\nFor the string \"hello\", the tokens are 'h','e','l','l','o'.\n\nFor 'l's:\n\nAt position 0: no previous, so 0.\n\nPosition 1: no previous 'l's, 0.\n\nPosition 2: one 'l' in previous two, 1/2.\n\nPosition 3: two 'l's in previous three, 2/3.\n\nPosition 4: two 'l's in previous four, 2/4=0.5.\n\nWait, but the example shows [0,0,1/3,1/2,2/5]. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps the function is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nThe example says:\n\nnum_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\nnum_l(\"hello\") returns [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\nWait, \"hello\" is 5 characters. So the output is 5 elements.\n\nAt position 0: no previous, so 0.\n\nPosition 1: no previous 'l's, 0.\n\nPosition 2: one 'l' in positions 0 and 1 (tokens 'h' and 'e'), so 0/2=0. But the example shows 1/3. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the selector includes the current position as well. Because in make_frac_prevs, the selector is LEQ, which includes the current index. So for position i, it includes 0 to i, which is i+1 elements.\n\nWait, in the example, for position 2 (third element), the selector includes indices 0,1,2. So three elements. If the token at index 2 is 'l', then in the previous elements (0 and 1), there are zero 'l's. So the fraction is 0/2=0. But the example shows 1/3.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the function is including the current element in the count. So perhaps the selector should be LT instead of LEQ, to only include previous elements.\n\nAh, that's another bug. In make_frac_prevs, the selector uses LEQ, which includes the current element. So when calculating the fraction of previous 'True's, it's including the current element, which is incorrect.\n\nSo to fix this, the selector should use LT instead of LEQ. That way, for position i, it only includes elements j < i, i.e., the previous elements.\n\nSo in make_frac_prevs, the line:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n\nshould be changed to:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\nThis way, each row includes only the previous elements, not including the current one.\n\nThat would fix the example in make_frac_prevs.\n\nSo to summarize, the two main issues are:\n\n1. In make_shuffle_dyck, the select_last uses length +1 instead of length -1, causing it to not select the last element.\n\n2. In make_frac_prevs, the selector uses LEQ, including the current element, which is incorrect for counting previous 'True's.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other issues.\n\nLooking at the make_pair_balance function, it seems correct once the make_frac_prevs is fixed.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_shuffle_dyck, the 'any_negative' is created by OR-ing all balances < 0. But each balance is an SOp, and the comparison returns a Selector. Then, when converted to numerical, it's 1.0 where True. But when aggregated, it's the average of 1s across the sequence. So 'has_neg' would be 1.0 if any position has a negative balance. But the code uses 'has_neg' as a boolean, but it's actually a numerical value. So when it's used in the final condition, it might not correctly represent whether any balance was negative.\n\nWait, but in the code, 'any_negative' is a Selector, then converted to numerical. Then, when aggregated with select_all, it's the average of 1s where any balance was negative. So if any balance was negative at any position, 'has_neg' would be non-zero. Then, 'not_has_neg' is the inverse, which would be zero if any balance was negative.\n\nBut in the final return, it's (last_zero & not_has_neg). So if any balance was negative, not_has_neg is zero, making the whole expression zero. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 'not_has_neg' is created as (~has_neg).named(\"not_has_neg\"). But 'has_neg' is a numerical SOp, so ~ would invert the values. But for numerical values, ~ would be a bitwise NOT, which is not intended. Instead, we should check if 'has_neg' is zero.\n\nWait, that's another bug. The code uses ~has_neg, which is incorrect for numerical values. Instead, it should check if 'has_neg' is zero.\n\nSo to fix this, instead of using ~has_neg, we should create a Selector that is True where 'has_neg' is zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'has_neg' should be a boolean Selector indicating whether any balance was negative. Then, 'not_has_neg' would be the inverse.\n\nBut in the current code, 'has_neg' is a numerical SOp where the value is 1.0 if any balance was negative, else 0. So to create a Selector that is True where 'has_neg' is zero, we can use a Select operation.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be modified as follows:\n\nInstead of:\n\nnot_has_neg = (~has_neg).named(\"not_has_neg\")\n\nWe should create a Selector that is True where 'has_neg' is zero.\n\nSo:\n\nnot_has_neg = rasp.Select(has_neg, rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens), rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"not_has_neg\")\n\nWait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a Map to convert 'has_neg' into a boolean indicating whether it's zero.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to ensure that 'has_neg' is a boolean Selector indicating whether any balance was negative. Then, 'not_has_neg' is simply the inverse.\n\nSo, in make_shuffle_dyck, the code should be adjusted to correctly compute 'has_neg' as a boolean indicating whether any balance was negative at any position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use Selector operations to compute 'any_negative' correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that 'any_negative' is a Selector, but when aggregated, it's treated as a numerical value. So the code should instead compute 'any_negative' as a boolean indicating whether any balance was negative.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This might be beyond the initial issues I found.\n\nSo, to recap, the main issues I found are:\n\n1. In make_shuffle_dyck, select_last uses length +1 instead of length -1.\n\n2. In make_frac_prevs, the selector uses LEQ instead of LT, including the current element.\n\nFixing these two should resolve the main issues.\n\nSo, I'll proceed to correct these two points in the code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    #
