Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to count the occurrences of each token. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LT, which creates a selector where each element (i,j) is True if tokens[i] < tokens[j]. Then, SelectorWidth counts the number of Trues in each row. But wait, if tokens[i] < tokens[j], that's not the same as counting occurrences. For example, if the input is \"abac\", the selector would have True where a < b, a < c, etc., but that doesn't count how many times each token appears. Instead, I think we should use EQ to match equal tokens. So, same_tok should be created with Comparison.EQ. That way, each row i will have True for all j where tokens[i] == tokens[j], and SelectorWidth will give the count.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's using keys and creating a 'smaller' selector with LT. Then target_pos is the count of Trues, which gives the number of keys smaller than each key. The idea is to assign each value to its sorted position. But when using rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), it's creating a selector where each row i selects the position j where target_pos[i] == indices[j]. Then, Aggregate uses this selector to pick the corresponding value. However, this might not work correctly because if multiple positions have the same target_pos, it could cause issues. Also, the way it's structured might not correctly map each value to its new position. I think this part is okay, but perhaps there's a better way to ensure each value is placed correctly.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. This ensures that keys are unique for sorting. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. This seems correct as it avoids tie-breaking issues.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (hist) as the count of each token. Then, it negates the hist so that higher frequencies come first. It uses make_sort with tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len and min_key. Wait, but in the original code, the hist is negated, so when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. But make_sort() is sorting based on the keys in ascending order. So, using negated hist should work. However, the parameters passed to make_sort in make_sort_freq are incorrect. The current code calls make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but according to the function definition, make_sort takes (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in make_sort_freq, the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But looking at the code, the parameters are correctly passed. Wait, no, in the original code, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: and inside, it's calling make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for the hist, which is based on token counts, adding this term would make each key unique. But hist is a sequence where each element is the count of that token. So when we sort based on these modified keys, tokens with the same count will be ordered based on their position, which is what we want because the example shows that tokens with the same frequency are output in their original order.\n\nBut let me check the make_sort_freq function again. It's creating hist as -1 * make_hist(), which inverts the counts. Then, it's using make_sort with vals as tokens and keys as hist. So when sorted, the tokens will be ordered from lowest to highest hist (which is -count), meaning highest to lowest count. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the example given for make_sort_freq, the input is [2,4,2,1], and the output is [2,2,4,1]. The hist for 2 is 2, 4 is 1, 1 is 1. So when negated, hist is -2, -1, -1. So when sorted in ascending order, -2 comes first, then -1, then -1. So the order would be 2,4,1. But the example output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the two 2's come first, then 4, then 1. So the sorting is correct.\n\nBut wait, the make_sort function is called with keys=hist, which is the negated counts. So the sorting is based on the negated counts. So lower values (more negative) come first. So tokens with higher counts come first, which is correct.\n\nBut I think the issue might be in how the make_sort function handles the keys. Let me check the make_sort function again. It takes keys and vals, modifies the keys to be unique, then calls make_sort_unique. So that should be okay.\n\nWait, but looking back at make_hist(), the original code uses Comparison.LT, which is incorrect. So that's the main issue. So I need to fix that.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. make_hist() uses Comparison.LT instead of EQ, so it's not counting occurrences correctly.\n2. The other functions might have issues, but I need to check each one.\n\nLet me go through each function step by step.\n\nFirst, make_hist():\n\nThe current code creates a selector where same_tok is tokens < tokens. Then, SelectorWidth gives the count of Trues in each row, which is the number of tokens that are less than the current token. That's not the histogram; it's something else. To get the histogram, we need to count how many times each token appears. So same_tok should be created with EQ, so that each row i has True for all j where tokens[i] == tokens[j]. Then, SelectorWidth will give the count, which is the histogram.\n\nSo, in make_hist(), change the predicate from LT to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique():\n\nIt creates a 'smaller' selector with LT, which is correct because it's checking if key[i] < key[j]. Then, target_pos is the count of Trues, which gives the number of keys smaller than key[i]. So for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of elements less than key[i], which would be the position where it should be placed in a sorted list. Then, sel_new is a selector where each row i selects the position j where target_pos[i] == indices[j]. So for each i, it selects the j where j is the target position. Then, Aggregate uses this selector to pick the value from vals at position j. This should correctly sort the values.\n\nWait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3] because each key is unique. So sel_new would select the diagonal, and Aggregate would pick the values in order. That seems correct.\n\nBut what if there are duplicate keys? For example, keys = [2,2,3]. Then, target_pos for the first 2 would be 0 (since no keys are smaller), the second 2 would also have target_pos 0, and 3 would have target_pos 2. Then, sel_new would select position 0 for both 2's, which would cause both to be placed at position 0, but that's not possible. So this function only works for unique keys, which is why make_sort() is used for non-unique keys by modifying them to be unique.\n\nSo make_sort_unique is correct as long as keys are unique.\n\nNow, make_sort():\n\nIt modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key, ensuring uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. This should handle non-unique keys correctly.\n\nFinally, make_sort_freq():\n\nIt calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort to sort the tokens based on the negated histogram. The max_seq_len is passed correctly. So this should work once make_hist is fixed.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_hist(). Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the hist is multiplied by -1. So the keys for sorting are the negative of the histogram counts. Since make_sort sorts in ascending order, the tokens with higher counts (more negative keys) will come first, which is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the predicate from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ.\n2. Ensure that all other functions are correctly using the operations.\n\nLet me also check the parameters in make_sort_freq. The function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. Then, inside, it's calling make_sort with max_seq_len and min_key=1. That seems correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort, when modifying the keys, it's using rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But since i starts from 0, the first element gets 0 added. Maybe it's better to start from 1, but I think it's okay because for i=0, it's 0, so the key remains the same. Wait, no: for i=0, it's x + min_key * 0 / max_seq_len, which is x. So the first element's key is unchanged. But if two elements have the same key, their modified keys would be x + 0 and x + min_key*1/max_seq_len, which are different. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, the key is increased by a small amount proportional to i. This ensures that even if two keys are the same, their modified keys will be different because i is unique. Thus, when passed to make_sort_unique, which requires unique keys, it works.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in make_hist().\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nIn make_hist(), change the predicate to EQ.\n\nSo, same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n\nThat should fix the histogram.\n\nTesting the example: for input \"abac\", the tokens are ['a','b','a','c']. The histogram should be [2,1,2,1]. With the corrected code, same_tok will have True where tokens are equal. So each row i will have True at positions where tokens[j] == tokens[i]. So for i=0 (a), j=0 and j=2 are True. So count is 2. Similarly for others.\n\nYes, that should fix it.\n\nNow, checking the other functions again to ensure they are correct.\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), the code seems correct. It's creating a 'smaller' selector, getting target_pos as the count, then selecting the position where target_pos equals the index, and aggregating.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are modified correctly to be unique.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is correctly calculated, negated, and used as keys for sorting.\n\nSo, the only change is in make_hist().\n\nI think that's the main issue. Let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 3240, "total_tokens": 7859}}, {"id": "gen-1738410444-vo7AldMC792koWpNqOjk", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410444, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_hist()` function where the incorrect comparison operator was used.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LT, which creates a selector where each element is True if the key is less than the query. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues in each row. Wait, but if I'm comparing each token to every other token, the count won't give the frequency correctly. Oh, right, because for each position, it's counting how many tokens are less than it, not how many times it appears. So that's wrong.\n\nSo to calculate the histogram, I should instead count how many times each token appears in the entire sequence. How can I do that? Maybe I need to create a selector where each row i is True for all positions j where token j equals token i. Then, SelectorWidth would give the count for each i.\n\nSo in make_hist(), I should use Comparison.EQ instead of LT. That way, same_tok will be True where tokens are equal. Then, SelectorWidth will sum the Trues, giving the frequency.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector which is True where keys[i] < keys[j]. Then target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. So when we select elements where target_pos equals the index, we get the sorted order. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3, 3, 2, 0], right? Because for key 2, there are three keys smaller than it (1,3,4? Wait no, the keys are [2,4,3,1]. So for each position i, how many keys j have key[j] < key[i]. Let's see:\n\ni=0, key=2: keys less than 2 are 1 \u2192 count is 1.\ni=1, key=4: keys less than 4 are 2,3,1 \u2192 count is 3.\ni=2, key=3: keys less than 3 are 2,1 \u2192 count is 2.\ni=3, key=1: no keys less than 1 \u2192 count 0.\n\nWait, but the target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So when we create sel_new as Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), it's looking for positions where the index equals the target_pos value. So for each i, it selects the j where j == target_pos[i]. Then, when we aggregate vals with this selector, each position i will pick the value from j where j is the target_pos[i]. That should arrange the values in sorted order. So make_sort_unique seems correct.\n\nNow, make_sort() function. It's modifying the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense to break ties. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature is correct.\n\nBut looking at the code, the keys are being reassigned. That's fine because it's within the function scope.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It's supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. It computes hist as -1 * make_hist(), which inverts the frequencies. Then it uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the original make_hist() was incorrect, so after fixing that, hist should be correct. But let's see: hist is the frequency, so when we negate it, the sorting will be in ascending order of frequency. So tokens with higher frequency come first? Or wait, no: when you sort by a key in ascending order, lower values come first. So if we negate the frequency, higher frequencies become more negative, so they would come first when sorted in ascending order. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, [2,4,2,1] has frequencies 2,1,2,1. So hist would be [2,1,2,1], then -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the keys' values. So the keys are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. So when sorted, the order would be the positions sorted by their key values. So the sorted order would be positions 1 and 3 (keys -1), then positions 0 and 2 (keys -2). But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the higher frequency tokens come first. So the sorting is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort() function, it's sorting based on the keys. So when the keys are -hist, the sorting is done in ascending order of -hist, which is equivalent to descending order of hist. So tokens with higher frequency come first. That's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_hist(), which was using LT instead of EQ. Once that's fixed, the rest should work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the predicate from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ. That way, same_tok is True where tokens are equal, and SelectorWidth gives the count.\n\n2.

Let me look through each function to see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LT, which creates a selector where each element is True if the key is less than the query. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. Wait, but using LT would count how many tokens are less than the current token, not the frequency. So this is incorrect. Instead, to count occurrences, we should use EQ comparison because we want to count all tokens equal to the current one. So I'll change the predicate from LT to EQ.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of True in each row, which gives the number of keys smaller than the current. Then it selects elements where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals. But wait, when you aggregate, if the selector is 1 in each position, it should pick the corresponding value. However, the way it's set up might not correctly map to the sorted order. Also, the function is named 'make_sort_unique', but the example shows it's used for sorting, so maybe the logic is correct, but I'll need to test it. Alternatively, perhaps the selector should be based on the rank, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think again: for each position i, target_pos is the number of keys less than key i. So when we select rows where target_pos equals the index, it should map each key to its sorted position. That makes sense. So maybe this function is okay, but I'll keep an eye out for any issues.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. This seems correct because it breaks ties by the position, ensuring stable sorting. So this function should be okay.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (frequency) of each token, multiplies by -1 to sort in ascending order of frequency. Then it uses make_sort with these hist values as keys. But wait, the current code passes hist as the keys, but in make_sort, the keys are modified. However, since the hist is based on frequency, which is the same for identical tokens, adding the position-based term will make them unique. So the sorting should first order by frequency (lower first because of the negative) and then by position for ties. That makes sense. But I need to check if the parameters are correctly passed. The function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp, and inside it calls make_sort with max_seq_len and min_key=1. That seems correct.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the initial code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut looking at make_sort's parameters, it's defined as make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So the call should pass vals as rasp.tokens and keys as hist. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the original make_sort_freq(), the example usage is sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), but the function definition only takes max_seq_len. That's a problem because the function is called with three arguments but only expects one. So the function definition is incorrect. It should probably take the tokens as an argument or use rasp.tokens directly. But according to the RASP principles, functions should use the core operations and not take sequences as arguments because they are generated at runtime. So perhaps the function should not take vals and keys as parameters but instead directly use rasp.tokens for both. Alternatively, the function might need to be adjusted.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which doesn't match the function's parameters. So this is an error. The function should either take the necessary parameters or not. Since in RASP, the functions typically operate on the input sequence, perhaps make_sort_freq should not take any tokens as arguments but use rasp.tokens for both values and keys. Or perhaps the function is intended to take the tokens as an argument, but the current code doesn't reflect that. So I need to fix the function signature.\n\nWait, the original code in the user's message shows:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nBut the example usage is:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n>> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\nWhich suggests that make_sort_freq is being called with two token arguments, but the function only expects max_seq_len. So the function definition is incorrect. It should probably take vals and keys as parameters, similar to make_sort. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the function should not have those parameters. But according to the problem statement, the functions should use the core RASP operations and not take sequences as arguments because the input is handled at runtime.\n\nWait, no. In RASP, each function builds an SOp, which when evaluated with an input sequence produces the output. So the functions like make_sort_freq() should create an SOp that, when called with a sequence, processes it. Therefore, the parameters like vals and keys in make_sort() are SOps, which are part of the RASP program, not the input sequences. So in make_sort_freq(), the code is correct because it uses rasp.tokens as the vals and hist as the keys. The example usage might be a mistake, or perhaps it's a different function. Alternatively, perhaps the function should not have those parameters. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the code is correct. Or perhaps the function needs to be adjusted to take the tokens as an argument.\n\nWait, no. The function make_sort_freq() is supposed to sort the tokens based on their frequency. So it should use rasp.tokens as the values to sort and the histogram as the keys. So the code inside make_sort_freq() is correct. The example usage might be a typo, but the function itself is okay.\n\nWait, but in the example, the function is called with three arguments, which doesn't match the function's parameters. So perhaps the function should be modified to take the tokens as an argument. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong. But according to the problem statement, the functions should be repaired, so I need to fix the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the function make_sort_freq() is intended to be called without any token arguments because it uses rasp.tokens internally. So the example usage is incorrect. Therefore, the function is correct as is, and the example is a mistake. But since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function should be adjusted to take the necessary parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should take the tokens as an argument. Let me think: in make_sort(), the function takes vals and keys as parameters, which are SOps. So in make_sort_freq(), perhaps it should take the tokens as an argument and use that for both vals and keys. So the function should be redefined to take tokens as a parameter.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq() doesn't take any tokens as parameters. So perhaps the function is incorrect because it's using rasp.tokens directly, which might not be the intended behavior. Alternatively, perhaps it's correct because it's a higher-order function that builds an SOp based on rasp.tokens.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again: in RASP, each function like make_sort() returns an SOp, which when evaluated with an input sequence produces the output. So the parameters like vals and keys in make_sort() are SOps that are part of the program, not the input. So when you create an SOp using make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), it's building a program that will process the input tokens.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the code is correct because it's using rasp.tokens as the vals and hist as the keys. The function doesn't need to take any token parameters because it's building an SOp that operates on the input tokens. So the example usage is incorrect because it's passing tokens to make_sort_freq(), which doesn't accept them. Therefore, the function is correct, and the example is wrong. But since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function should be adjusted to take tokens as an argument if that's the intended usage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not take any parameters and just use rasp.tokens internally. So the function is correct as is, and the example is a mistake. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the other functions and come back to this.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in RASP, the indices start from 0, so for position i, the term is min_key * i / max_seq_len. However, if max_seq_len is the maximum sequence length, then for i=0, it's 0, which doesn't add anything. But for i=1, it's min_key * 1 / max_seq_len, which is a small value. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a tiny increment based on their position. That makes sense for breaking ties.\n\nWait, but in the function make_sort(), the keys are being modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x at position i, it's x plus a small value. But if the keys are not unique, this will make them unique by adding a tiny amount based on their position. So when sorted, the order will be first by key value, then by position. That's correct for stable sorting.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the function is named 'make_sort' and is supposed to return an SOp. The code seems correct.\n\nNow, going back to make_hist(). The original code uses Comparison.LT, which is incorrect. It should use EQ to count the number of equal tokens. So I'll change that.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. make_hist() uses Comparison.LT instead of EQ. This needs to be fixed.\n2. make_sort_freq() is called with incorrect parameters in the example, but the function itself is correct. However, perhaps the function should take tokens as an argument if that's intended.\n\nWait, perhaps the function make_sort_freq() is supposed to take the tokens as an argument, similar to make_sort(). Let me check the original code again.\n\nIn the original code, make_sort_freq() is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nBut in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function should take tokens as the first argument. So perhaps the function is missing parameters. Therefore, I need to adjust the function to take the tokens as an argument.\n\nSo, the function should be redefined to take tokens as a parameter, and then use that for both the histogram and the values to sort. So the corrected function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(tokens: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which would imply that the function expects two token arguments, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the function should take only one token argument, which is used for both the values and the keys (hist). So the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut then the example usage is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the function should take the tokens as an argument, so the code becomes:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(tokens: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut then, in the example, the function is called with two token arguments, which is incorrect. So perhaps the function is intended to take only the max_seq_len and use rasp.tokens internally. Therefore, the function is correct as is, and the example is wrong. But since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function should be adjusted to take the tokens as an argument if that's the intended usage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is a mistake, and the function is correct. I'll proceed under the assumption that the function is correct as is, and the example is a typo.\n\nSo, the main issue is in make_hist(), which uses LT instead of EQ. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_unique(), the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). But the Aggregate function's default is None, which is correct. So that's fine.\n\nWait, in the Aggregate function, the default is set to None, which is correct according to the rules.\n\nSo, to recap, the changes needed are:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the predicate from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ.\n2. Ensure that all functions are correctly using the core RASP operations and that the parameters are correctly passed.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if the functions are properly named and if the variables are correctly used.\n\nSo, the corrected code would have make_hist() using EQ, and the other functions as is, except for any parameter issues.\n\nWait, another thing: in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in RASP, the indices start from 0, so for the first element, i=0, which adds nothing. But when you have duplicate keys, the addition will make them unique by adding a small value based on their position. So the sorting will be first by key, then by position, ensuring stability.\n\nAnother point: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is multiplied by -1 to sort in ascending order of frequency. So tokens with higher frequency come first because their hist is more negative. Wait, no: when you sort using make_sort(), which sorts by the keys in ascending order. So if hist is -frequency, then lower frequencies (less negative) come first. Wait, no: for example, if token A has frequency 3, token B has 2. Then hist for A is -3, B is -2. When sorted in ascending order, -3 comes before -2, so A comes before B, which is correct because higher frequency comes first. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in make_hist().\n\nWait, let me test make_hist() with the example. The example says that hist(\"abac\") should return [2,1,2,1]. Let's see:\n\nInput: \"abac\" \u2192 tokens are ['a','b','a','c']\n\nFor each token, count how many times it appears.\n\n- 'a' appears at positions 0 and 2 \u2192 count 2\n- 'b' appears once\n- 'a' again \u2192 count 2\n- 'c' appears once\n\nSo the output should be [2,1,2,1].\n\nBut with the current code, same_tok is created with Comparison.LT, which would count the number of tokens less than the current token. For 'a', how many tokens are less than 'a'? Let's see:\n\nAssuming the tokens are compared based on their values. So 'a' is compared to each token:\n\nIn the selector, each row corresponds to a token, and each column to another token. The value is True if the row's token is less than the column's token.\n\nFor 'a' (row 0), the selector would be True for tokens less than 'a' (none, since 'a' is the first), so count is 0. But the desired count is 2. So clearly, using LT is incorrect. Therefore, changing to EQ will correctly count the number of equal tokens.\n\nSo, the fix is to change the predicate in make_hist() from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 4528, "total_tokens": 9147}}, {"id": "gen-1738410720-b02pSTfHEu84URVTgoQg", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410720, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified that the `make_hist()` function incorrectly used the `Comparison.LT` predicate.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LT, which creates a selector where each element is True if the key is less than the query. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. Wait, but using LT would count how many tokens are less than the current token, not the frequency. So this is incorrect.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"abac\", the tokens are ['a','b','a','c']. The current code would compare each token to all others using LT, which isn't the right approach. Instead, to count occurrences, we should be checking for equality, not less than. So I should change the predicate from LT to EQ.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector where each element is True if keys[i] < keys[j]. Then target_pos is the count of Trues, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the index, and then aggregates vals. But wait, in the current code, sel_new is using target_pos and rasp.indices with EQ. That should correctly select the position where each value should go. But I'm not sure if this handles all cases correctly, especially when there are duplicate keys. However, the function is intended for unique keys, so maybe it's okay.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). This function adjusts the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. It then calls make_sort_unique. The adjustment is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. But since i starts at 0, the first element doesn't get any addition. This might cause issues if the original keys are the same but the adjusted keys are not unique enough. Also, using rasp.indices gives 0-based indices, which is correct. But perhaps the scaling should be such that the added term is smaller than the possible differences in keys. Not sure if this is a problem, but the function seems logically sound.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (frequency) of each token, negates it so that higher frequencies come first, and then sorts based on these negated frequencies. The problem is that when frequencies are the same, the original order should be preserved. However, the current implementation uses make_sort() with the negated histogram as keys. But make_sort() uses the adjusted keys, which might not preserve the original order when frequencies are equal because it adds a term based on position, making the keys unique. Wait, but in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated histogram. So tokens with the same frequency will have the same key, but make_sort() will adjust them by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique, so the sorting will be stable in the sense that the original order is maintained because the adjustment is based on position. So this should work.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the hist is calculated as -1 * make_hist(). So lower frequencies come first. But when we sort, we want higher frequencies first. So negating the histogram makes sense because when we sort in ascending order, higher frequencies (more negative) come first. But wait, no. If hist is the frequency, then -hist would be lower for higher frequencies. So when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies would come first. That's correct.\n\nBut let me think about the make_sort() function. It's supposed to sort the vals based on the keys. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated frequencies. So the tokens are sorted in ascending order of their negated frequencies, which is the same as descending order of their actual frequencies. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort(), the keys are being adjusted to be unique by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for tokens with the same frequency, their adjusted keys will be different because i is their position. So when sorted, the tokens with the same frequency will be ordered based on their position, which preserves the original order. That's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_hist(). It's using Comparison.LT instead of EQ. So I need to change that.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. In make_sort_unique(), the 'smaller' selector is correctly using LT, which is appropriate for sorting. The target_pos is the count of elements smaller than each key, which gives the position where each element should be placed. Then sel_new selects the exact position, and aggregates the values. That seems correct.\n\nSo the only repair needed is in make_hist(). Change the predicate from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nIn make_hist(), same_tok should be created with Comparison.EQ. So the line becomes:\n\nsame_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n\nThat should correctly count the number of occurrences of each token.\n\nI think that's the only change needed. Let me make sure there are no other issues.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is named \"hist\", but in the original code, it's named after make_hist().named(\"hist\"). That's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the keys are being adjusted with min_key * i / max_seq_len. Since i is 0-based, the first element gets 0 added. But if min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is 5, then each subsequent element gets 0.2 added. So for keys that are the same, they become unique. That should work.\n\nI think that's all. So the main fix is in make_hist().\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2010, "total_tokens": 6629}}, {"id": "gen-1738410780-AWZrdaVruLPjkLp1CZvr", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410780, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_hist()` function where the comparison predicate was incorrectly set to `Comparison.LT` instead of `Comparison.EQ`, leading to incorrect frequency counts.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with LT comparison, which gives a selector where each element is True if the key is less than the query. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. Wait, but using LT would count how many tokens are less than the current token, not the frequency. So this is incorrect. Instead, to count occurrences, we should use EQ comparison because we want to count all tokens equal to the current one.\n\nSo in make_hist(), the Select should use Comparison.EQ instead of LT. That way, each row i will have True for all positions j where token j equals token i. Then SelectorWidth will give the count of each token.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector where each element (i,j) is True if key i is less than key j. Then target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which gives the number of keys smaller than the current key. The idea is that the target position for each element is its rank in the sorted order.\n\nBut wait, when using rasp.Select, the keys and queries are both keys. So for each i, j, it's checking if keys[i] < keys[j]. The target_pos for i would be the number of j where keys[i] < keys[j], which is the correct rank. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the index, and aggregates vals. That seems correct, but let me think about an example. Suppose keys are [2,4,3,1]. The smaller selector would have rows indicating how many keys are smaller than each key. For key 2, there's 1 (key 1). For key 4, there are 3 (2,3,1). For key 3, there are 2 (2,1). For key 1, none. So target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then, for each position i, we select the val where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, only j=3 (target_pos 0) is selected, so val is 1. For i=1, j=0, val is 2. For i=2, j=2, val is 3. For i=3, j=1, val is4. So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. So make_sort_unique seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique using max_seq_len and min_key. It adds min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. So for each position i, the key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique because the added term is unique for each position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That makes sense because the sorting will be based on the original key, but the added term breaks ties by position, ensuring uniqueness. So this function seems correct.\n\nFinally, make_sort_freq(). It's supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. It computes hist as the negative of make_hist(), which would give the negative frequency. Then it uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, but in make_sort, the keys are sorted in ascending order because it's using the < relation. So using negative hist would sort from lowest frequency to highest. But the example given is [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these keys. The smallest key is -2, then -1. So the sorted order would be the elements with key -2 first, then -1. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the order of the original tokens sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). Wait, but the hist for 2 is 2, so -hist is -2. So when sorted, the elements are ordered by their -hist values. So the first element would be the one with the smallest key, which is -2, then next smallest, etc. So in the example, the tokens are [2,4,2,1]. Their hist is [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The make_sort function will sort based on these keys. The sorted order would arrange the tokens in the order of their keys from smallest to largest. So the first token (2) has key -2, the third token (2) also has -2, the second (4) has -1, and the fourth (1) has -1. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So this seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is multiplied by -1. So when passed to make_sort(), which sorts based on the keys in ascending order, the tokens will be ordered from least frequent to most frequent. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the order of the input. Wait, no, the example says that after sorting, it's [2,2,4,1]. Let me see: the frequencies are 2 for 2, 1 for 4, 1 for 1. So when sorted by frequency in ascending order, the order would be 4,1,2,2. But the example output is [2,2,4,1], which is the opposite. So perhaps the hist is being used correctly, but the sorting is in the wrong order.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. The make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if the keys are the negative of the histogram, then higher frequencies become smaller keys. So when sorted, the tokens are arranged from smallest key (most frequent) to largest (least frequent). Wait, no: because the key is -hist, so higher hist (more frequent) leads to smaller (more negative) keys. So when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent tokens come first. So in the example, the tokens 2 appear twice, so their keys are -2. Tokens 4 and 1 have keys -1. So when sorted, the 2's come first, then 4 and 1. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2's are first, followed by 4 and 1. So the function is correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort_freq() function, the hist is negated. So when passed to make_sort(), which sorts in ascending order, the tokens are ordered from most frequent to least. So the example is correct. So why is the output [2,2,4,1]? Because 2 is more frequent than 4 and 1, so it comes first. So the function is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the code, in make_sort_freq(), hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(). So the keys for sorting are negative frequencies. Then, when make_sort() is called, it sorts the tokens based on these keys in ascending order. So tokens with smaller keys (more negative) come first. So higher frequency tokens have smaller keys and appear earlier. So the sorting is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example given in make_sort_freq(), the input is [2,4,2,1], and the output is [2,2,4,1]. Let's compute the hist: each 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So hist is [2,1,2,1]. Then, -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The make_sort function will sort the tokens based on these keys. So the order is determined by the keys: the tokens are sorted in the order of their keys from smallest to largest. So the first token has key -2, the third token also has -2, the second has -1, and the fourth has -1. So the sorted order would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo all functions seem correct. Wait, but the user said that the program is incorrect and needs repair. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at make_hist(), the original code uses Comparison.LT. That's definitely wrong because it counts the number of tokens less than the current token, not the frequency. So that's a bug. So in make_hist(), same_tok should be created with Comparison.EQ, not LT. That's the main issue.\n\nSo the first step is to fix make_hist() by changing the predicate to EQ.\n\nNow, checking the other functions again. Are there any other issues?\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), the 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals the index. But target_pos is a SequenceMap that's based on the number of smaller keys. So for each position i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than key[i]. So when we create a selector where target_pos equals the index, we're selecting all j where the number of keys less than key[j] is equal to the current index. Then, when we aggregate vals, each position i will get the value from the j where target_pos[j] == i. That correctly sorts the values.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if max_seq_len is zero? Well, the function requires max_seq_len to be provided, so it's up to the caller to ensure it's positive. So that's probably okay.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is correctly computed as the frequency, then negated so that sorting in ascending order places higher frequencies first.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_hist(), which uses LT instead of EQ. Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nSo the corrected code would change the predicate in make_hist() from LT to EQ.\n\nLet me write the corrected functions.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2969, "total_tokens": 7588}}, {"id": "gen-1738410897-UEU7QfqCOBguEdE8NOfD", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410897, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we need to correct the implementation of the histogram function and ensure all other components are functioning as intended.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n\n1. **make_hist()**: The original implementation incorrectly uses `rasp.Comparison.LT`, which counts the number of tokens less than the current token.

Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. Wait, but using LT would count how many tokens are less than the current token, not the frequency. So that's incorrect. Instead, to count occurrences, we should check for equality. So I should change the predicate to Comparison.EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's using rasp.Select with keys and keys, and Comparison.LT to create a 'smaller' selector. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of this selector. The idea is to find the position where each key should be placed. But when we use rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), it's creating a selector that matches each index to the target position. Then Aggregate is used to pick the corresponding value. That seems correct, but I should double-check if the logic for sorting is accurate. Maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That makes sense to break ties. I don't see an immediate issue here, but perhaps the way the keys are modified could be improved. However, the function seems logically correct.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (frequency) of each token, then negates it so that higher frequencies come first. Then it uses make_sort with these negative frequencies as keys. The problem is that when frequencies are the same, the original order should be preserved. However, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This might interfere with the sorting when frequencies are the same because it adds a small value based on position, ensuring that earlier tokens come first. So that should maintain the original order for tokens with the same frequency. So maybe this part is correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated. So when sorting, lower (more negative) values come first, which corresponds to higher frequencies. That seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issue is in make_hist(). So I'll correct that by changing the predicate to EQ. Let me also check the other functions for any possible issues.\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), when creating sel_new, it's using target_pos and rasp.indices with EQ.

That seems correct for unique keys, but I should double-check.\n\nIn make_sort(), the function modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. But wait, the original code has a function signature issue. The parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key), but in the example usage, make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function definition should have default values or be adjusted. Wait, looking at the code, the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp: which is correct because the example calls it with positional arguments after the first two. So that's okay.\n\nThen make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it (so higher frequency comes first), and then sorts using make_sort. But wait, the current code in make_sort_freq() is calling make_sort with (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1), but the function expects (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So the way the arguments are passed is incorrect. It should pass them as keyword arguments. So the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if the original keys are not unique, this ensures they become unique by adding a small value based on their position. That makes sense.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), hist is calculated as -1 * make_hist(), which gives lower values for higher frequencies. So when sorting, higher frequency tokens come first. But when there's a tie in frequency, the original order is preserved because the sort is stable? Or does the key modification ensure that? I think the key modification in make_sort() adds a small value based on position, so tokens with the same frequency will be ordered by their original positions. So that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. make_hist() uses Comparison.LT instead of EQ, so it's not counting occurrences correctly.\n2. make_sort_freq() calls make_sort() without keyword arguments for max_seq_len and min_key, which might cause parameter mismatch.\n\nSo, for make_hist(), I'll change the predicate to Comparison.EQ.\n\nFor make_sort_freq(), I'll adjust the make_sort() call to pass max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any issues. In make_sort_unique(), the Aggregate is correctly used with the selector, and the default is None, which is correct.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are correctly modified, and then make_sort_unique is called. That should work.\n\nSo the corrected code would involve changing the predicate in make_hist() and fixing the function call in make_sort_freq().\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1669, "total_tokens": 6288}}, {"id": "gen-1738411009-JUkZHF5xYa2T08vx6WNZ", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411009, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_hist()` function where the predicate was incorrectly set to `Comparison.LT` instead of `Comparison.EQ`, leading to incorrect frequency counts.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LT, which creates a selector where each element is True if the key is less than the query. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues in each row. Wait, but if I'm comparing each token to every other token, the count might not be correct. Oh, right, because for each position, it's counting how many tokens are less than the current token. That's not the same as the frequency. So this function isn't correctly calculating the histogram. Instead, I should use Comparison.EQ to count how many times each token appears in the entire sequence. So I'll change the predicate to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's using the \"smaller\" selector to find where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of Trues, which gives the position where each key should be placed. The selector sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Then it aggregates vals using this selector. But wait, the Aggregate function with a selector that has only one True per row (since keys are unique) should pick the correct value. That seems okay, but I should double-check if the selector is correctly formed.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The lambda function is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. But using division here might cause issues with integer keys. Also, the way it's added could affect the sorting order. Maybe using a multiplication without division would be better, ensuring that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. So I'll adjust the lambda to x + min_key * (i / max_seq_len), but perhaps using a different scaling to avoid floating point issues if possible. Alternatively, since max_seq_len is given, maybe the scaling is correct as is.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the hist is negated, so when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. However, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But since the hist is based on frequency, which could be the same for multiple tokens, this should ensure that tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original positions. That makes sense.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is using hist as the keys. But in the current code, the hist is negated, so when sorted, lower values (more negative) come first, which corresponds to higher frequencies. But the make_sort function sorts in ascending order based on keys. So this should correctly order tokens by frequency.\n\nBut let me check the parameters. In make_sort_freq(), when calling make_sort, it's passing max_seq_len and min_key=1. So the keys (which are the negated hist) will have min_key * i / max_seq_len added. Since hist is negated, adding a small value based on position ensures that tokens with the same frequency are sorted by their original order. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x, it becomes x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. Since i is the index, this adds a small value that increases with position. So when two keys have the same x, the one with a higher i (later in the sequence) will have a slightly higher key, causing it to be placed after in the sorted order. But since we want to preserve the original order for ties, this might not be the desired behavior. Hmm, perhaps the addition should be such that earlier positions have smaller additions, so that when keys are the same, the original order is maintained. Wait, no, because when you add a value that increases with i, for the same x, the key becomes larger as i increases. So when sorting in ascending order, the smaller keys (earlier i) come first, which preserves the original order. So that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issue was in make_hist() where the predicate was LT instead of EQ. Fixing that should resolve the histogram calculation. The other functions seem logically correct, but I should ensure that all Aggregate calls have default=None, which they do.\n\nSo, the corrected code would involve changing the predicate in make_hist() to EQ.

Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues in each row. Wait, but using LT would count how many tokens are less than each token. That's not the same as the frequency. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 2, 3], the current code would count for each position how many tokens are less than it. But we need to count how many times each token appears in the entire sequence.\n\nSo, the problem is that make_hist() is incorrectly using Comparison.LT. Instead, it should use Comparison.EQ to match tokens that are equal. That way, the selector will have True where tokens are the same, and SelectorWidth will give the count.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector using Comparison.LT, which is correct for finding elements where keys are smaller. Then target_pos is the count of Trues, which gives the position where each element should be placed. The sel_new selector uses EQ to select the target position. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. That seems correct, but I should double-check if the Aggregate is using the correct default. The default is None, which is fine.\n\nNow, make_sort() function. It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That makes sense because it breaks ties based on the original position, ensuring stability. I don't see an issue here.\n\nThe make_sort_freq() function computes the histogram and then sorts based on the negative histogram. Wait, hist is calculated as -1 * make_hist(), which would sort tokens in ascending order of their frequency. But when using make_sort(), it's sorted by the keys in ascending order. So tokens with lower frequency (more negative) would come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the frequencies are 2:2, 4:1, 1:1. So the sorted order should be 2,2, then 4 and 1. But since 4 and 1 have the same frequency, their order is determined by their original positions. In the example, 4 is at position 2 and 1 at 4, so 4 comes before 1. So the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated. So when passed to make_sort(), which sorts by keys in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency (more negative hist) will come first. So the sorting is correct.\n\nBut let me check the make_sort() function again. It's using the modified keys to ensure uniqueness. So when frequencies are the same, the original order is preserved because the keys are made unique based on their positions.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issue is in make_hist(). It should use EQ instead of LT. So I'll change that.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n1. In make_hist(), replace Comparison.LT with Comparison.EQ in the Select call. This will correctly count the occurrences of each token.\n\nOther functions seem okay, but I should ensure that all Aggregate calls have default=None, which they do.\n\nSo the corrected code will have make_hist() using EQ.

The current implementation uses rasp.Select with Comparison.LT, which creates a selector where each element is True if the key is less than the query. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. Wait, but using LT would count how many tokens are less than the current token, not how many times each token appears. That's not correct for a histogram. Instead, I think we should use EQ comparison because we want to count all occurrences of the same token. So, same_tok should be created with Comparison.EQ.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_unique(). It's using rasp.Select with keys and keys, and Comparison.LT to create a 'smaller' selector. Then target_pos is the SelectorWidth of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. That seems correct for a sort function when all keys are unique. So maybe no issue here.\n\nNow, make_sort() function. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. I don't see an obvious issue here, but perhaps when min_key is added, it's better to ensure that the keys are unique without overlapping. But the function seems logically correct.\n\nThe make_sort_freq() function is using make_hist() to get the histogram, then negates it so that higher frequencies come first. It then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the current make_hist is incorrect because it's using LT instead of EQ. So after fixing make_hist, this should work. But also, in make_sort_freq, the parameters passed to make_sort might be incorrect. Let me check: make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key). But looking at the function definition, make_sort takes vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key. So in make_sort_freq, the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the original make_sort_freq, the parameters passed to make_sort were (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which doesn't match. Oh, no, looking back, the user's code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, no, the original code in the user's message is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user's code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, no, the function definition is make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int), but in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't make sense because the function only takes max_seq_len as an argument. So that's a problem. The function should probably take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort. Or perhaps the example is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their frequency, so the keys would be the histogram, and the vals would be the tokens. So the function should take max_seq_len, but perhaps the way it's called in the example is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the function should be defined to take the necessary parameters.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the make_sort_freq function calls make_sort with rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. That doesn't seem right. Because the keys should be the histogram, which is hist. So the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which is correct. But in the example usage, the user is calling make_sort_freq with rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5. But the function only expects max_seq_len. So that's a problem. The function signature is incorrect. It should probably take vals and keys as parameters, but in this case, it's designed to sort the tokens based on their frequency, so maybe it's intended to be used with rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. But the example usage seems wrong because it's passing three arguments to a function that expects one.\n\nSo, the issues are:\n\n1. make_hist uses Comparison.LT instead of EQ, so it's not counting occurrences correctly.\n2. make_sort_freq's example usage is incorrect because it's passing three arguments to a function that expects one.\n3. make_sort_freq's function call to make_sort uses rasp.tokens as both vals and keys, which might not be correct because the keys should be based on the histogram.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. make_sort is supposed to sort vals based on the keys. So in make_sort_freq, the vals are rasp.tokens (the tokens to be sorted), and the keys are hist (the histogram counts). So the call is correct. But the function make_sort_freq is defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter, but in the example, it's being called with three arguments. So the function definition is wrong. It should probably be defined without any parameters except max_seq_len, but the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the function should take the tokens as an argument, but that's not how it's written.\n\nWait, no, the function is supposed to return an SOp, which when evaluated with an input sequence will produce the sorted output. So the function doesn't need to take the tokens as an argument because it's using rasp.tokens internally. So the example usage is incorrect because it's trying to pass arguments to the function when it's expecting only max_seq_len.\n\nSo, to fix this, the example usage should be corrected, but the function itself is okay. Alternatively, perhaps the function should take the tokens as an argument, but that's not necessary because it's using rasp.tokens.\n\nWait, no, in RASP, the functions are built using rasp.tokens and other SOps, so when you create the SOp, it's based on the input tokens. So the function make_sort_freq is correctly using rasp.tokens, so when you call the returned SOp on an input, it will process that input. So the example usage is wrong because it's trying to pass the tokens to make_sort_freq, which doesn't accept them. The correct usage would be to create the SOp with make_sort_freq(5), then evaluate it on the input [2,4,2,1].\n\nSo, the main issues are:\n\n- make_hist is using LT instead of EQ.\n- make_sort_freq's example usage is incorrect, but the function itself is correct once make_hist is fixed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. In make_hist, change the predicate from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ. That way, same_tok will be a selector where each row i is True for all j where token j equals token i. Then, SelectorWidth will count the number of True in each row, which is the frequency of each token.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, ensure that the call to make_sort uses the correct parameters. But looking at the code, it's correctly calling make_sort with vals=rasp.tokens, keys=hist, and the other parameters. So that's fine.\n\n3. Correct the example usage in the docstring of make_sort_freq to reflect that make_sort_freq is called with only max_seq_len, and then the returned SOp is called with the input sequence.\n\nWait, but in the user's code, the make_sort_freq function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut make_sort expects the parameters (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key), so the call is correct.\n\nSo, the main fix is in make_hist.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any issues.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the code is:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nThis seems correct. For each position, target_pos is the number of keys smaller than the current key, which gives the position where the current element should be in the sorted array. Then, sel_new selects the indices where target_pos equals the current index, and aggregates the values accordingly.\n\nIn make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. This way, when keys are the same, the index slightly increases them, making them unique. Then, make_sort_unique is called with these modified keys. This should handle sorting correctly even when keys are not unique.\n\nSo, the only issue is in make_hist, which is using the wrong comparison. Changing that should fix the histogram.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, hist is negated so that higher frequencies come first. So when sorting, the tokens with higher frequencies appear earlier, which is correct.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main correction is in make_hist. Also, the example usage in make_sort_freq's docstring is incorrect, but that's a documentation issue, not a code issue. However, since the user is asking to repair the program, perhaps the function definitions and examples should be corrected as well.\n\nWait, looking back, in the user's code, the make_sort_freq function's example usage shows:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n>> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\nBut the function make_sort_freq is defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter. So the example is incorrect. The correct way is to call make_sort_freq(5), then evaluate the returned SOp on the input.\n\nSo, the example should be:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(5)\nsort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n>> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\nTherefore, the docstring's example usage is wrong and should be corrected.\n\nSo, the steps to repair the code are:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the predicate from Comparison.LT to Comparison.EQ.\n2. In make_sort_freq's docstring, correct the example usage to reflect the correct way of calling make_sort_freq.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq, the function returns the sorted tokens based on frequency, but the code is correct once make_hist is fixed.\n\nSo, the final code will have these corrections.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 3328, "total_tokens": 7947}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.2}
