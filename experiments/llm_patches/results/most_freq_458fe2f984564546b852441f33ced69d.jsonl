Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals the negative of indices. Wait, rasp.indices is 0-based, so multiplying by -1 would give negative indices, which doesn't make sense. Oh, I think the intention was to create a selector that selects the position where the target_pos matches the index. But using rasp.indices * -1 is incorrect because indices are 0,1,2,3 and multiplying by -1 gives -1,-2,-3,-4, which won't match target_pos. So this is a bug.\n\nSo in sel_new, instead of using rasp.indices * -1, we should just use rasp.indices. Or perhaps, since target_pos is the count of smaller keys, which would be the correct position to place each element in a sorted list. So the selector should match where target_pos equals the index. So the correct line should be rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ). That way, for each position i, it selects all j where target_pos[j] == i, meaning the j-th element should be placed at i.\n\nSo the fix is to change sel_new to use rasp.Select with target_pos and rasp.indices, using EQ.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. It uses rasp.SequenceMap with x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. That should add a small value to each key based on their position, ensuring that keys are unique. So this part looks fine.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. Then it calls make_sort with these keys. Wait, the problem is that in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but hist is the negative of the histogram. So the keys are the negative counts. When sorting, lower keys come first, so higher counts come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the counts are 2 for 2, 1 for 4, 1 for 1. So the hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the keys. The smallest key is -2, so the first two elements (positions 0 and 2) have key -2. But how are they ordered among themselves? Since the keys are the same, the original order is preserved. So in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using hist as the keys. So the code is correct in that aspect. So I don't see an issue here.\n\nWait, looking back at make_sort_unique, the bug is in sel_new. So I need to fix that.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if max_seq_len is zero? No, because max_seq_len is a parameter provided by the user, and it's the maximum sequence length, so it's at least 1. So that's okay.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). Wait, no, looking at the code, the function is defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter. But in the example, it's called with three arguments. Wait, no, the example in the code is:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n\nBut the function definition is def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. So that's a problem because the function expects only one argument, but it's being called with three. Wait, no, looking back, the code provided has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, no, the function make_sort_freq is defined with max_seq_len as the only parameter. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That would be incorrect because the function doesn't accept those arguments. So this is a bug.\n\nWait, no, looking at the code, the function make_sort_freq is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the example, the user is calling it with make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That's a problem because the function doesn't take those arguments. So the function definition is incorrect. It should probably take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort. Or perhaps the example is wrong.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nSo this function returns a program that sorts the tokens based on their frequency. So the function doesn't take vals or keys as parameters because it's specifically sorting the tokens based on their own frequency. So the example usage is incorrect. The correct way to use it would be:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(5)\nsort([2,4,2,1])  # returns [2,2,4,1]\n\nBut in the provided code's example, it's called with three arguments, which is wrong. So the function is correct, but the example is wrong. However, the user's task is to repair the program, not the example. So perhaps the function is correct, but the example is misleading. So I don't need to fix that.\n\nWait, but the function make_sort_freq is using rasp.tokens as the vals and hist as the keys. So it's sorting the tokens based on their frequency. So the function is correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique, where sel_new is incorrectly using rasp.indices * -1. I need to fix that.\n\nSo to recap, the bugs are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) is incorrect. It should be rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ).\n\n2. The example usage in make_sort_freq is incorrect, but that's not part of the code to repair.\n\nSo I'll fix the make_sort_unique function.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the sel_new should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nSo the corrected function is:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nI think that's the main fix needed.\n\nWait, let me test this with an example. Suppose keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector will be True where keys[i] < keys[j]. The target_pos for each j is the number of keys less than keys[j]. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, it selects j=3 (since target_pos[3]=0). For i=1, j=0. For i=2, j=2. For i=3, j=1. So the aggregate will pick vals[3], vals[0], vals[2], vals[1], resulting in [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the fix should resolve the issue.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), when modifying keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. Since i is the index (starting from 0), adding this value ensures that each key is unique. For example, if two keys are the same, their indices will differ, so the modified keys will be different. This should handle tie-breaking correctly.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 2844, "total_tokens": 7466}}, {"id": "gen-1738410422-gzaRLXq7EK6U2wETUPpJ", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410422, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified an issue in the `make_sort_unique` function where the negative indices were incorrectly created.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. The sel_new selector is supposed to select the position where the index matches target_pos. But wait, the code uses rasp.indices * -1. Oh, that's a problem because rasp.indices is a sequence, and multiplying by -1 isn't valid. Maybe it should be rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices) instead. Also, when using Select, both keys and queries should be SOps. So I'll correct that part.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. It uses rasp.SequenceMap with keys and indices, which is fine.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified, which might not be necessary here since hist is already unique? Or maybe it's okay because the min_key and max_seq_len are provided. Hmm, perhaps the issue is in how make_sort_unique is used. Also, in make_sort_freq, the parameters passed to make_sort might be incorrect. Let me check the function signature: make_sort takes vals, keys, max_seq_len, and min_key. In make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys, which is correct. But when it calls make_sort, it's using max_seq_len and min_key=1. That should be okay.\n\nWait, looking back at make_sort_unique, the sel_new is using rasp.Select with target_pos and rasp.indices * -1. That's the problem. rasp.indices is an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't allowed. I need to create a new SOp that represents the negative indices. So I'll replace rasp.indices * -1 with rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices).\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_unique, the Aggregate is using sel_new as the selector and vals as the sop. That should correctly pick the values based on the selector. But I should ensure that the selector is correctly formed.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, fix the sel_new selector by correctly creating the negative indices.\n2. Ensure that all Select operations use valid SOps for both keys and queries.\n\nSo, in make_sort_unique, I'll replace the line:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nwith:\n\nneg_indices = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices)\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, neg_indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThat should fix the issue where rasp.indices * -1 is invalid.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for similar issues. In make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort seems correct. The hist is negated to sort in ascending order of frequency.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the hist is created as -1 * make_hist(), which might not be necessary. Because make_hist() returns the count, so using it directly as the key should sort by frequency. But negating it would reverse the order. So if we want to sort from highest frequency to lowest, that's correct. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). So the code is correct as is.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort, when creating the new keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with keys and rasp.indices. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so adding min_key * i / max_seq_len might not be sufficient to ensure uniqueness if min_key is too small. But that's a design choice, not a code error.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort_unique where the negative indices are incorrectly created.

Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals -indices. Wait, rasp.indices is 0-based, so multiplying by -1 would reverse the order. But when using Select, the keys are target_pos and the queries are -indices. So for each position i, it's checking if target_pos[j] == -i. That might not be correct because indices are 0,1,2,3 and -i would be 0,-1,-2,-3. So the comparison would only match when target_pos[j] is equal to -i, which seems off. Maybe the intended logic is to find the position where the count of smaller keys equals the index, but the current setup might not be correctly aligning them. Perhaps the Select should compare target_pos with (rasp.indices - 1) or something else. Alternatively, maybe the multiplication by -1 is incorrect. Let me think about the example: for input [2,4,3,1], the keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector would be checking for each key if it's less than others. The target_pos for each position would be the number of keys smaller than it. So for position 0 (key 2), there's 1 (key 1) that's smaller, so target_pos[0] is 1. For position 1 (key4), target_pos is 3. Position 2 (key3) has target_pos 2. Position3 (key1) has target_pos 0. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, EQ). So for each row j, it's checking if target_pos[j] equals -i for each i. So for j=0, target_pos is 1. So it's looking for i where -i ==1, which is i=-1, which doesn't exist. So the selector would have all False. That can't be right. So the problem is in how sel_new is constructed. Instead of using -rasp.indices, maybe we should use rasp.indices as is, but perhaps adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the Select should compare target_pos with (rasp.indices -1) or another expression to correctly find the sorted positions.\n\nWait, the goal is to create a selector where for each j, we select the i where target_pos[j] == i. Because target_pos[j] is the number of elements smaller than j, which would be the position where j should be placed in the sorted array. So for each j, we want to select the i such that i is the target position. So the selector should be Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Because for each j, target_pos[j] is the desired index i. So the current code uses rasp.indices * -1, which is incorrect. That's probably the bug. So in make_sort_unique, the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) should be changed to sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ). That way, for each j, it selects the i where target_pos[j] equals i.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. For example, adding a small value based on position to break ties. That makes sense.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it (so higher frequency comes first), and then uses make_sort with these negated hist as keys. Wait, no: hist is computed as the count, then negated. So when sorting, lower (more negative) values come first, which would sort tokens by descending frequency. But in the example given, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the hist is [2,1,1,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be 0,1,2,3 because -2 is the smallest. So the sorted tokens would be [2,4,2,1], but wait, the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, maybe the way the keys are being handled isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the make_sort function is not correctly handling the sorting when keys are the same. Because in make_sort, it uses make_sort_unique, which expects unique keys. But in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated histogram, which could have duplicates. So when multiple tokens have the same frequency, their keys are the same, and make_sort_unique might not handle that correctly because it's designed for unique keys. That's a problem. So the current approach would fail when there are ties in frequency because make_sort_unique expects unique keys. Therefore, the make_sort_freq function is incorrect because it relies on make_sort_unique, which can't handle duplicate keys. Instead, make_sort should be used, which can handle duplicates by using the position to break ties. So in make_sort_freq, instead of using make_sort_unique, it should use make_sort with appropriate parameters. But wait, make_sort requires max_seq_len and min_key. So perhaps in make_sort_freq, after negating the hist, we should add a small value based on the position to ensure uniqueness, similar to how make_sort does it. Alternatively, perhaps the approach in make_sort_freq is flawed because it's using make_sort_unique, which can't handle ties. So to fix this, make_sort_freq should instead use make_sort with the modified keys that include position-based increments to ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the selector sel_new is incorrectly using -rasp.indices. It should use rasp.indices.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, using make_sort_unique is incorrect because the keys (negated hist) might have duplicates, leading to incorrect sorting. Instead, make_sort should be used with the keys modified to ensure uniqueness.\n\nLet me address each issue step by step.\n\nFirst, for make_sort_unique:\n\nThe current code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThis is wrong because it's comparing target_pos[j] to -i. Instead, it should compare target_pos[j] to i. So the correct line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nSecond, in make_sort_freq:\n\nThe function currently does:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, hist)\n\nBut since hist can have duplicate values (when tokens have the same frequency), make_sort_unique will not work correctly because it expects unique keys. So instead, we should use make_sort, which can handle duplicates by adjusting the keys to be unique.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify make_sort_freq to use make_sort instead of make_sort_unique. To do that, we need to adjust the keys by adding a small value based on the position, similar to how make_sort does it.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, after computing hist, we negate it and then modify the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len, where i is the position. Then, we pass these modified keys to make_sort, which will sort based on these unique keys.\n\nWait, but make_sort requires max_seq_len and min_key as arguments. So in make_sort_freq, we have max_seq_len as a parameter. So we can compute the modified keys as:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, hist, rasp.indices)\n\nThen, call make_sort with these keys.\n\nWait, but in the current make_sort_freq, the hist is negated. So the keys would be based on the negative histogram plus the position-based term.\n\nSo, the revised make_sort_freq would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    # Ensure unique keys by adding position-based value\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + 1.0 * i / max_seq_len, neg_hist, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1.0)\n\nWait, but in the original make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So in make_sort_freq, we can do the same. So the code would be:\n\nhist = make_hist()\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (1.0 * i / max_seq_len), neg_hist, rasp.indices)\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1.0)\n\nBut wait, the original make_sort function already takes care of modifying the keys. So perhaps in make_sort_freq, after negating the hist, we can directly call make_sort with the negated hist as keys, along with max_seq_len and min_key. Because make_sort will then modify the keys further to ensure uniqueness.\n\nWait, no. Because make_sort's purpose is to sort based on the given keys, ensuring they're unique by adding the position-based term. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated histogram. So we can call make_sort with these keys, and let make_sort handle the uniqueness.\n\nSo the revised make_sort_freq would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1.0)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, make_sort_freq was using make_sort_unique, which is incorrect. So changing it to use make_sort is the fix.\n\nSo putting it all together, the changes needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, fix the Select call to use rasp.indices instead of -rasp.indices.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, change make_sort_unique to make_sort, and pass the necessary parameters.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nFor make_sort_unique:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    # Fix: use rasp.indices instead of -rasp.indices\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nFor make_sort_freq:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    # Use make_sort instead of make_sort_unique\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So when we pass neg_hist as keys, make_sort will further modify them, ensuring uniqueness. That should handle the tie-breaking correctly.\n\nSo these are the main changes. Let me check if there are any other issues.\n\nLooking back at make_sort, the function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nWait, no. The original make_sort function is:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nBut wait, this is incorrect because make_sort_unique expects unique keys, but after modifying the keys, they should be unique. So the approach is correct. So in make_sort_freq, by using make_sort with the negated hist as keys, the function will handle the tie-breaking.\n\nSo the final changes are as I outlined.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 3714, "total_tokens": 8336}}, {"id": "gen-1738410674-BI47bNtpco28MUMW90VC", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410674, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was incorrectly using negated indices.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals -indices. Wait, rasp.indices is 0-based, so multiplying by -1 would reverse the order. But when using rasp.Select, the keys are target_pos and the queries are -rasp.indices. So for each position i, it's checking if target_pos[j] == -i. That might not be correct because indices are 0,1,2,3 and -i would be 0,-1,-2,-3. So the equality would only match when i=0. That doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe it's supposed to align each target_pos with the correct position in the output. Hmm, perhaps the way sel_new is constructed is incorrect. Let me think: target_pos is a sequence where each element is the number of keys smaller than the current key. So for each element in keys, target_pos[i] tells us how many keys are smaller than keys[i]. So to sort, each element should move to the position equal to target_pos[i]. So the selector should match when the target_pos of the source is equal to the index in the output. So maybe the queries should be rasp.indices, not -rasp.indices. Because for each i in output, we want to select all j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). That way, for each output position i, it selects all j where target_pos[j] is i, which would be the elements that should go into position i. So the current code uses target_pos and -rasp.indices, which is wrong. That's probably the bug.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique(), the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) is incorrect. It should be rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ). Because we want to find for each output index i, all j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. The lambda is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So each key is adjusted by a small amount based on its position, ensuring that keys are unique. That makes sense.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, then negates it to sort by frequency. But wait, the hist is the count of each token. So when we negate it, smaller values come first. So when sorting, higher frequency tokens come first because their hist is higher, and after negation, they are smaller. But in the example given, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then when sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the tokens with higher frequency (hist=2) come first. So in the example, the two 2's and the two 4's? Wait, no, the input is [2,4,2,1], so the hist is [2,1,2,1]. So the keys after negation are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. So when sorted, the order is based on these keys. So the sorted order would be the elements with the smallest keys first. So -2 is smaller than -1, so the elements with key -2 come first. So the first two elements (indices 0 and 2) have key -2, and the next two (indices 1 and 3) have key -1. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is using hist as the key. But in the current code, it's written as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the keys are the hist, which is the frequency. So when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with lower frequency come first. But in the example, the tokens with higher frequency (2 occurs twice) should come first. So perhaps the sort is in the wrong order. Because the default in make_sort_unique is to sort in ascending order based on keys. So if the keys are the hist (frequency), then lower frequencies come first. But in the example, the higher frequencies should come first. So maybe the keys should be negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. That's what the code does: hist is negated. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. The code in make_sort_freq() does hist = -1 * make_hist(). So the keys are negative frequencies. Then, when make_sort() is called with these keys, it sorts the tokens based on these keys in ascending order. So tokens with smaller (more negative) keys come first. Since the keys are negative frequencies, tokens with higher original frequency have more negative keys, so they come first. That's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique(), where the selector is incorrectly using -rasp.indices. Let me correct that.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique(), the line:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nshould be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBecause we want to select for each output position i, all j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Is this the correct way to ensure uniqueness? Yes, because each position i adds a unique value based on its index, scaled by min_key and max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique, allowing the sort to work correctly even if original keys are not unique.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort() function, the keys are being passed as the modified keys. So when make_sort_unique() is called, it uses these unique keys, ensuring that each has a unique position. That makes sense.\n\nSo the main bug is in make_sort_unique(), where the selector is constructed with -rasp.indices instead of rasp.indices. Correcting that should fix the issue.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other possible issues.\n\nIn make_hist(), the code seems correct. It's using Select with EQ on tokens, then SelectorWidth to get the counts.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the code correctly negates the histogram and uses it as the key for sorting.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique(), correcting the selector.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 2376, "total_tokens": 6998}}, {"id": "gen-1738410753-kKk04lJtFNApAWhe8Qu4", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410753, "choices": [{"error": {"message": "Exception: Chunk too big", "code": 502, "metadata": {"provider_name": "DeepInfra", "raw": {"error_type": "unknown_error", "error_message": "Exception: Chunk too big"}}}, "logprobs": null, "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals -indices. Wait, rasp.indices is 0-based, so multiplying by -1 would reverse the order. So sel_new would select the position where the count of smaller keys matches the negative index. Then Aggregate uses this selector to pick vals. But wait, the example shows that when keys are [2,4,3,1], the output is [1,2,3,4]. Let me think: for each position, it's finding the correct place in the sorted order. Hmm, maybe this works, but I'm not sure. Let me think about how the Aggregate works. It averages the selected values, but since each selector row has only one True, it's effectively selecting the value at that position. So this should correctly sort the values based on the keys. So maybe this function is okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then calls make_sort_unique. Wait, the original function signature in the provided code is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function seems correct. But wait, in the code, the first line inside make_sort is keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...). But the parameters are vals and keys, and then it reassigns keys. That's fine. So this function seems okay.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It computes hist as -1 * make_hist(). Then passes hist as the keys to make_sort. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first. But wait, when you multiply by -1, the hist becomes negative. So when sorting, lower values come first. So the most frequent tokens would have the smallest (most negative) hist values, so they would be sorted first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the hist for 2 is 2, 4 is 1, 1 is 1. So -hist is -2, -1, -1. So when sorted in ascending order, the order would be 2 (since -2 is smallest), then 4 and 1. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So why is the function not working as expected?\n\nWait, the function make_sort_freq is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't match because the function expects only max_seq_len as an argument. Oh, that's a problem! The function signature is incorrect. It should take vals and keys as parameters, but in the current code, it's only taking max_seq_len. So when the example tries to call it with tokens, it's incorrect.\n\nSo the error is in the function definition of make_sort_freq. It should probably take vals and keys, but in the current code, it's not. Let me check the original code again.\n\nLooking back, the provided code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The make_sort function expects vals and keys as the first two arguments. So in make_sort_freq, it's calling make_sort with rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. But hist is a SOp that represents the frequency counts. So the function is trying to sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nBut the function make_sort_freq is supposed to return a function that takes tokens, right? Or is it a SOp that can be applied directly? Wait, no. The make_sort_freq function is supposed to return a SOp that, when called, sorts the input tokens by their frequency.\n\nWait, no. The make_sort_freq function is a higher-order function that returns a SOp. So when you create sort_freq = make_sort_freq(max_seq_len=5), then sort_freq(tokens) would sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nBut in the current code, make_sort_freq is not taking any vals or keys. Instead, it's directly using rasp.tokens. That's a mistake because when you create the SOp, it should be based on the input tokens, not the global rasp.tokens.\n\nSo the problem is that make_sort_freq is not parameterized correctly. It should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort. But in the current code, it's not. So when you call make_sort_freq, it's not using the correct keys and vals.\n\nSo to fix this, make_sort_freq should take vals and keys as parameters. But looking at the example usage, the user does make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). So the function should accept vals and keys, and max_seq_len.\n\nWait, the original code's make_sort_freq is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. That's incorrect because it's missing the vals and keys parameters. So the function should be redefined to accept these.\n\nSo the correct approach is to modify make_sort_freq to take vals and keys, compute the histogram based on those, and then sort them.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq is using rasp.tokens to compute the histogram, which is incorrect because it should be based on the input tokens passed to the function.\n\nSo the steps to fix make_sort_freq are:\n\n1. Change the function signature to accept vals and keys, and max_seq_len.\n2. Compute the histogram based on the input tokens (probably vals).\n3. Use this histogram as the keys for sorting.\n4. Adjust the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness.\n5. Call make_sort_unique with the adjusted keys.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq is using make_sort, which already handles adding min_key. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- make_sort_freq should create a histogram of the input tokens.\n- Then, use this histogram as the keys for sorting.\n- Since keys might not be unique, we need to make them unique by adding a small value based on their position.\n- Then, sort the tokens based on these adjusted keys.\n\nSo the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()(keys)  # Wait, no. make_hist() returns a SOp that, when evaluated, gives the histogram. So perhaps we need to compute the histogram based on the keys.\n\nWait, no. The histogram is the count of each token in the input. So if the input is the tokens, then the histogram is based on the tokens. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the tokens, and the histogram is computed on the tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> Callable[[rasp.SOp, rasp.SOp], rasp.SOp]:\n    def sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n        hist = make_hist()(keys)\n        # Then proceed as before\n    return sort_freq\n\nBut that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the function should directly take the necessary parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code for make_sort_freq is incorrect because it's not using the correct keys and vals. Let me think again.\n\nIn the example, the user does:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) => [2,2,4,1]\n\nBut in the current code, make_sort_freq is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nThis is incorrect because it's using rasp.tokens inside make_sort_freq, which is not the correct way. Instead, it should create a SOp that, when applied to the input, computes the histogram based on the input tokens.\n\nSo the correct approach is to have make_sort_freq return a SOp that, when evaluated, sorts the input tokens based on their frequency.\n\nSo the function should be redefined to take vals and keys as parameters, but wait, no. The make_sort_freq function is a higher-order function that returns a SOp. So perhaps the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    # Create a SOp that, when applied, sorts the input tokens by frequency.\n    # So inside this function, we need to create the necessary SOp expressions.\n\n    # Compute the histogram of the input tokens.\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\n    # Since we want to sort by frequency, we'll use hist as the key.\n    # But to ensure uniqueness, we add a small value based on position.\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (1.0 * i) / max_seq_len,\n        hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    ).named(\"adjusted_keys\")\n\n    # Now, sort the tokens based on adjusted_keys.\n    # We need to create a SOp that represents the sorted tokens.\n    # So we use make_sort_unique, which expects vals and keys.\n    # Here, vals is rasp.tokens, and keys is adjusted_keys.\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys).named(\"sorted_tokens\")\n\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but in this case, the function make_sort_freq is creating a SOp that uses rasp.tokens directly. But when the SOp is applied, it's given an input sequence. So perhaps this approach is not correct because the SOp needs to be based on the input tokens, not the global rasp.tokens.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how RASP works. Each SOp is a function that, when evaluated with an input sequence, produces an output sequence.\n\nSo make_sort_freq should return a SOp that, when called with an input sequence, sorts the tokens in that sequence based on their frequency.\n\nSo inside make_sort_freq, I need to create a SOp that represents this sorting process.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the histogram of the input tokens. This is done by make_hist(), which returns a SOp. So when the SOp is evaluated, it gives the frequency of each token.\n\n2. Adjust the histogram values to make them unique by adding a small value based on their position. This ensures that when sorting, ties are broken by the original order.\n\n3. Use these adjusted histogram values as the keys to sort the original tokens.\n\nSo putting it all together, the make_sort_freq function should create a SOp that does these steps.\n\nBut how to structure this in code.\n\nWait, perhaps the make_sort_freq function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    # Compute histogram\n    hist = make_hist()\n    # Adjust keys\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (1.0 * i) / max_seq_len,\n        hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    )\n    # Sort tokens based on adjusted keys\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys)\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nBut wait, this is not correct because make_sort_unique expects to be called with specific vals and keys, but here we're trying to create a SOp that represents the sorting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make_sort_freq should return a lambda function that, when applied, performs these steps. But in RASP, functions are composed using the provided operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to create a SOp that, when evaluated, performs the sorting based on the frequency.\n\nSo the make_sort_freq function should return a SOp that represents the sorted tokens.\n\nSo the steps inside make_sort_freq are:\n\n- Create a histogram of the input tokens.\n- Adjust the histogram to ensure unique keys.\n- Sort the tokens based on these adjusted histogram values.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len),\n        hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    )\n    # Now, create a SOp that sorts the tokens based on adjusted_keys\n    # Using make_sort_unique, which returns a SOp that sorts vals based on keys.\n    # Here, vals is rasp.tokens, keys is adjusted_keys.\n    return make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but make_sort_unique is a function that takes vals and keys as arguments and returns a SOp. So when we call make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys), it returns a SOp that, when evaluated, will sort the tokens based on the adjusted keys.\n\nBut in this case, the adjusted_keys are based on the histogram of the input tokens, which is computed within make_sort_freq.\n\nWait, but the way RASP works is that each SOp is a function that processes the input sequence. So when make_sort_freq returns a SOp, that SOp, when evaluated, will compute the histogram, adjust the keys, and sort the tokens.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct way to structure it. Alternatively, perhaps the make_sort_freq function should be a higher-order function that returns a SOp which, when applied, performs these steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the original code, make_sort_freq is not correctly parameterized. It's missing the vals and keys parameters, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nSo to fix the code, I need to adjust the function signatures and ensure that all necessary parameters are passed correctly.\n\nAnother issue I noticed is in make_sort_unique. The function creates a selector 'sel_new' by selecting where target_pos equals -rasp.indices. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so -rasp.indices would be 0, -1, -2, etc. That might not be correct because target_pos is the number of keys smaller than each position, which is a non-negative integer. So comparing it to negative indices might not align correctly.\n\nWait, let's think about the example where keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector would be:\n\nrow 0: [F, F, F, T] because 2 < 1 is false, but wait no. Wait, the keys are [2,4,3,1]. So for each position i, 'smaller' is the selector where keys[j] < keys[i].\n\nSo for i=0 (key=2), j=0: 2<2? No. j=1:4<2? No. j=2:3<2? No. j=3:1<2? Yes. So row 0 is [F,F,F,T].\n\nSimilarly, for i=1 (key=4), all j's where key[j] <4: j=0 (2<4), j=2 (3<4), j=3 (1<4). So row1 is [T,T,T,F].\n\nFor i=2 (key=3), j=0 (2<3), j=3 (1<3). So row2 is [T,F,T,F].\n\nFor i=3 (key=1), no j where key[j]<1. So row3 is all F.\n\nThen target_pos is the sum of each row, which is [1,3,2,0].\n\nThen sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals -rasp.indices. But rasp.indices are [0,1,2,3], so -indices are [0,-1,-2,-3]. So for each i, sel_new[i][j] is T if target_pos[i] == -j.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because target_pos is [1,3,2,0], and -j is 0,-1,-2,-3 for j=0,1,2,3.\n\nSo for i=0, target_pos is 1. So looking for j where 1 == -j. That would be j=-1, which is invalid. So no selection for i=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. This would cause the Aggregate to return None for all positions, which is not correct.\n\nAh, so this is a bug. The original code in make_sort_unique is incorrect because it's using -rasp.indices, which leads to invalid indices. Instead, it should be using rasp.indices shifted by the length or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to create a selector where for each i, j is such that the number of keys less than i is equal to j. So for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than i's key. Then, for each i, we want to select the j where j == target_pos[i]. So the selector should be where j == target_pos[i].\n\nBut how to represent this in RASP.\n\nWait, perhaps the selector should compare rasp.indices (which is [0,1,2,3]) to target_pos, which is a SOp. So the selector is created by rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, Comparison.EQ).\n\nWait, no. Because target_pos is a SOp that, when evaluated, gives the count for each position. So to create a selector where for each i, j is selected if j == target_pos[i], we can do rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, Comparison.EQ).\n\nWait, but rasp.Select expects two SOps as keys and queries. So perhaps the correct way is to create a selector where for each i, j is selected if j == target_pos[i]. So the selector is created by comparing rasp.indices (as keys) with target_pos (as queries) using EQ.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBut wait, rasp.indices is a SOp that returns the indices of the sequence. So when we pass rasp.indices as keys and target_pos as queries, the Select will compare each key (index) with each query (target_pos[i]).\n\nSo for each i, j, the selector[i][j] is True if j == target_pos[i].\n\nThis way, each row i will have a single True at position j = target_pos[i], which is the correct position to place the value.\n\nSo in the example where target_pos is [1,3,2,0], the selector will be:\n\nRow 0: j=1 \u2192 True\nRow 1: j=3 \u2192 True\nRow 2: j=2 \u2192 True\nRow 3: j=0 \u2192 True\n\nSo when we Aggregate, each row i will select the value from position j where j == target_pos[i], effectively sorting the tokens.\n\nSo the bug in make_sort_unique is that it's using rasp.Select with target_pos and -rasp.indices, which is incorrect. It should instead compare rasp.indices with target_pos.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort_unique should be:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nWait, no. Because target_pos is a SOp that, when evaluated, gives a sequence of integers. So when we create sel_new as rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ), it's comparing each index i to target_pos[i]. So for each i, j, selector[i][j] is True if j == target_pos[i]. That's correct.\n\nSo the fix is to change the sel_new line in make_sort_unique.\n\nAnother issue is in make_sort_freq. The original code is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut this is incorrect because it's using rasp.tokens inside make_sort_freq, which is not the correct way. Instead, it should create a SOp that, when applied, computes the histogram based on the input tokens.\n\nWait, no. The make_sort_freq function is supposed to return a SOp that, when called with an input sequence, sorts the tokens based on their frequency. So inside make_sort_freq, we need to create a SOp that represents this computation.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    # Compute the histogram of the input tokens\n    hist = make_hist()\n    # Adjust the histogram to make keys unique\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len),\n        hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    )\n    # Sort the tokens based on adjusted_keys\n    return make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but this is still using rasp.tokens, which is the original input. But when the SOp is applied, it's given an input sequence, so perhaps this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_sort_freq function should not hardcode rasp.tokens but instead use the input tokens. But I'm not sure how to structure this.\n\nWait, perhaps the make_sort_freq function should return a SOp that, when applied, takes the input tokens, computes their histogram, adjusts the keys, and sorts them.\n\nSo the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    # Create a SOp that represents the sorting process\n    # First, compute the histogram\n    hist = make_hist()\n    # Adjust the histogram values\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len),\n        hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    )\n    # Sort the tokens based on adjusted keys\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys)\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nBut again, this uses rasp.tokens, which might not be correct because when the SOp is applied, the input is the tokens, and rasp.tokens inside the SOp refers to that input.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. Because when you create a SOp using rasp.tokens, it refers to the input sequence when the SOp is evaluated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the selector is incorrectly using -rasp.indices. It should use rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, the function is not correctly parameterized and is using rasp.tokens instead of the input tokens. But upon closer inspection, perhaps the way it's structured is correct because the SOp returned will process the input tokens correctly.\n\nWait, no. The make_sort_freq function is supposed to return a SOp that, when called with an input sequence, sorts that sequence based on the frequency of its tokens. So the SOp should be built using rasp.tokens, which represents the input sequence.\n\nSo the make_sort_freq function is correct in that aspect.\n\nWait, but in the original code, make_sort_freq is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut this is incorrect because it's using make_sort, which is designed for numerical keys, and the hist is negated. Also, the function is not correctly using the adjusted keys to ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to have make_sort_freq compute the histogram, adjust it, and then use make_sort_unique.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    adjusted_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len),\n        hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(rasp.tokens, adjusted_keys).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in this case, the adjusted_keys are hist + i/max_seq_len. Since hist is the frequency count, adding a small value based on position ensures that tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original position.\n\nSo this should correctly sort the tokens by frequency, and for ties, by their original order.\n\nPutting all the fixes together:\n\n- Fix make_sort_unique to use the correct selector.\n- Fix make_sort_freq to correctly compute the adjusted keys and use make_sort_unique.\n\nSo the final code would have:\n\nIn make_sort_unique, change sel_new to rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\nIn make_sort_freq, recompute the adjusted keys correctly and use make_sort_unique.\n\nAdditionally, the function signature of make_sort_freq in the original code is incorrect. It should take max_seq_len as a parameter and return a SOp that uses the input tokens.\n\nWait, no. The original code's make_sort_freq is defined with only max_seq_len, which is correct because it's a higher-order function that returns a SOp. The SOp, when applied, will process the input tokens.\n\nSo, the main fixes are in make_sort_unique and make_sort_freq.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, when it adjusts the keys, it's using min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq, we're adding i / max_seq_len. Maybe the min_key should be 1, as in the original code.\n\nWait, in make_sort, the adjustment is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So in make_sort_freq, perhaps we should use a similar approach, ensuring that the adjustment is sufficient to make keys unique.\n\nSo, perhaps in make_sort_freq, the adjusted_keys should be hist + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len, with min_key=1.\n\nBut since hist is the frequency, which can be any integer, adding a small fraction should ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo, to sum up, the changes needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, fix the selector to compare rasp.indices with target_pos using EQ.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, correctly compute the adjusted keys by adding i/max_seq_len to the histogram, then use make_sort_unique.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4631, "completion_tokens": 5860, "total_tokens": 10491}}, {"id": "gen-1738410946-D8DKDcTQ8SvTE58FyZy5", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410946, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where an invalid operation was used.

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll check each function one by one.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's an issue here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The sel_new selector is supposed to select the position where the index matches target_pos. Wait, the code uses rasp.indices * -1. Oh, that's a problem because rasp.indices is a sequence of integers, and multiplying by -1 would flip their signs, but in RASP, you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. So this line is incorrect. Instead, we should create a new SOp that represents the negative indices. Maybe using rasp.Map to multiply each index by -1.\n\nThen, the Aggregate uses sel_new to select vals. But since the default is None, it should correctly place the values where the selector is True. So the main issue is the incorrect use of * -1 on rasp.indices.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. The lambda function in SequenceMap adds x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. That should make each key unique based on their position. So that part is fine.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. Then calls make_sort with these keys. The issue is that in make_sort, the keys are being modified, but in this case, the keys are the negative histogram. So when make_sort adds min_key * i / max_seq_len, it's adding to the negative histogram, which might not be intended. Wait, no, because make_sort is called with hist as keys, and then inside make_sort, the keys are further modified. But perhaps the way the sorting is done isn't correct because the frequency is being used as the sort key, and the tie-breaker is the position. So I'm not sure if that's the issue, but let's focus on the obvious error first.\n\nThe main problem is in make_sort_unique where rasp.indices * -1 is used. So I need to fix that line.\n\nSo, in make_sort_unique, the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) is incorrect. Instead, I should create an SOp that represents the negative indices. I can do this by using rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices). Then, use this new SOp in the Select.\n\nLet me adjust that. So, I'll create neg_indices = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices). Then, sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, neg_indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ).\n\nWait, no. Because target_pos is a sequence where each element is the count of smaller keys. For example, if the keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0] because each element counts how many keys are smaller than it. So for the first element (2), there are 3 smaller elements (4,3,1? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. If keys are [2,4,3,1], then for each key, how many are smaller?\n\nWait, for key at position 0 (2), the number of keys smaller than 2 is 1 (only 1). So target_pos would be [1,0,1,0]. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how 'smaller' is computed.\n\nWait, 'smaller' is a selector where each row i is True for all j where keys[j] < keys[i]. So the width of each row is the number of keys smaller than keys[i]. So for [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector's width would be:\n\n- For i=0 (2): keys less than 2 are [1] \u2192 width 1.\n- For i=1 (4): keys less than 4 are [2,3,1] \u2192 width 3.\n- For i=2 (3): keys less than 3 are [2,1] \u2192 width 2.\n- For i=3 (1): no keys less than 1 \u2192 width 0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0].\n\nThen, sel_new is supposed to select the position where the index matches target_pos. But the original code uses rasp.indices * -1, which is invalid. So instead, I should create an SOp that is the negative of indices. So neg_indices = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices). Then, sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, neg_indices, EQ). Because for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of smaller elements, which corresponds to the position where the element should be placed. For example, the first element (2) should be placed at position 1 (since it's the second smallest). So in the selector, for row i, we're looking for j where neg_indices[j] == target_pos[i]. Wait, no. Because target_pos[i] is the count, which is the desired position in the sorted array. So for i=0, target_pos is 1, so we want to select the j where j == 1. But rasp.indices are [0,1,2,3]. So to get the position, perhaps we should create an SOp that is the desired position, which is target_pos, and then select where rasp.indices equals that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The original code was trying to create a selector where for each i, it selects the j where j is equal to target_pos[i]. So the correct way is to create an SOp that represents the target positions, and then compare with rasp.indices.\n\nSo, target_pos is an SOp that has the desired positions. So, the selector should be Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Because for each i, we want to select the j where rasp.indices[j] equals target_pos[i]. That way, each row i will have a True at position j where j is the target position for i.\n\nWait, no. Because in the Select function, the keys are target_pos, and the queries are rasp.indices. So for each key in target_pos (which is a scalar for each i), we compare it to each query in rasp.indices (which are the j's). So the selector will have True in row i, column j where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nSo, the correct way is to create sel_new as rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So in the original code, the line was using rasp.indices * -1, which is incorrect. So the fix is to change that line to use rasp.indices directly, without multiplying by -1.\n\nSo, in make_sort_unique, the line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThat way, for each i, it selects the j where j equals target_pos[i], which is the correct position to place the value.\n\nSo, the error was using rasp.indices * -1, which isn't valid. Instead, we should just compare target_pos with rasp.indices.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, but when used as keys in make_sort, which then adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. So the sorting is based on the negative frequency plus a tie-breaker based on position. That should work because higher frequency (more negative) comes first, and for same frequencies, the earlier positions come first.\n\nWait, no. Because in make_sort_freq, hist is made by make_hist, which returns the count. Then it's negated, so higher counts become more negative. So when sorted in ascending order (since make_sort uses the < relation), the more negative values come first, which corresponds to higher frequencies. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the main issue is in make_sort_unique where the selector was incorrectly using rasp.indices * -1. So I need to correct that line.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\nIn make_sort_unique, replace:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nwith:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the line was:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWhich is invalid because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar. So the correct approach is to create an SOp that is the negative of indices, but only if needed. But in this case, it's not needed because target_pos is the count, which is the desired position. So comparing target_pos to rasp.indices directly is correct.\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort_unique function should have that line fixed.\n\nLet me also check if there are other issues. For example, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. That should work for numerical keys.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, so when used as keys in make_sort, the sorting will be in ascending order of the negated hist, which is descending order of the original hist. So tokens with higher frequency come first. If two tokens have the same frequency, the one appearing first (smaller index) will have a smaller negated hist plus the tie-breaker, so it will come first. Wait, no. Because in make_sort, the keys are the negated hist plus (min_key * i / max_seq_len). So for tokens with the same hist, the one with smaller i (earlier position) will have a smaller key, so they will be sorted first. So the sorted output will have tokens ordered by frequency descending, and for ties, by their original position ascending. That's correct according to the example.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in make_sort_unique, fixing the selector.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with this fix.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 3011, "total_tokens": 7633}}, {"id": "gen-1738411030-EOl8zvHFxZzu7M80WCCa", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411030, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we need to address issues in the `make_sort_unique` and `make_sort_freq` functions.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The sel_new selector is supposed to select the position where the index matches target_pos. But wait, the code uses rasp.indices * -1. Oh, that's a problem because rasp.indices is a sequence, and multiplying by -1 isn't valid. Maybe it should be rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices) instead. Also, when using Select, both keys and queries should be SOps. So the line should be corrected to use a proper SOp for the queries.\n\nThen, in make_sort(), the function takes max_seq_len and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. That makes sense. But when calling make_sort_unique, it passes the modified keys. That part seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as the key. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified, which might not be correct because hist is already a frequency count. Also, the parameters passed to make_sort in make_sort_freq are incorrect. The function expects 'vals' and 'keys' as the first two arguments, but in the current code, it's passing rasp.tokens as both, which is wrong. It should pass the tokens as 'vals' and hist as 'keys'. Also, the min_key should be 1, but maybe that's not the right approach for frequency sorting.\n\nLet me outline the steps to fix each function.\n\nFor make_sort_unique():\n- The sel_new selector is incorrectly using rasp.indices * -1. I'll replace that with a Map that negates each index.\n\nFor make_sort():\n- The function seems okay, but I need to ensure that the keys are correctly modified.\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n- The call to make_sort is incorrect. It should pass 'vals' as rasp.tokens and 'keys' as hist. Also, since hist is a frequency count, adding min_key might not be appropriate. Maybe the min_key should be adjusted or perhaps a different approach is needed to ensure unique keys for sorting.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. But when using make_sort, which sorts by the key's value, the min_key and max_seq_len are used to add a small value to each key to make them unique. So for hist, which is a count, adding min_key * i / max_seq_len should still work to break ties consistently.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, the correct call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key). But looking at the current code, the parameters are (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which is wrong. It should be (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key).\n\nPutting it all together, I'll correct each function step by step.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 1633, "total_tokens": 6255}}, {"id": "gen-1738411087-iNUyXvw4bDElVe9BiW38", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411087, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified and fixed two main issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Index Handling in `make_sort_unique`:** The original code incorrectly used `rasp.indices * -1`, which isn't valid.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then SelectorWidth to count. That seems correct. So probably no issue here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by comparing keys with LT. Then gets target_pos as the width, which is the number of elements less than each key. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and -indices, using EQ. Wait, rasp.indices is 0-based, so multiplying by -1 gives negative indices. But Select expects SOps, and rasp.indices is an SOp. So rasp.indices * -1 should be a Map that negates each index. But in the code, it's written as rasp.indices * -1, which might not be correct because SOps don't support multiplication directly. Oh, right, in RASP, to negate, you have to use Map. So this line is incorrect. It should be rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices) instead.\n\nSo the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) is wrong. It should use a Map to negate the indices.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. The lambda is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. That should make each key unique based on their position.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. Then calls make_sort with these keys. Wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1. So when make_sort is called, the keys (which are -hist) are being adjusted. But hist is the frequency count. So for tokens with the same frequency, their keys will be made unique by adding their position. That should maintain the original order for tokens with the same frequency. So that part seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't match because the function expects only max_seq_len. So the function definition is incorrect. It should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort. Or perhaps the example is wrong. Wait, looking back, the example shows make_sort_freq being called with tokens and tokens, but the function doesn't accept those. So the function definition is wrong. It should probably take vals and keys, but in the current code, it's only taking max_seq_len. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no, looking at the code again, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example, it's used as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That's a mismatch because the function expects only one argument. So the function definition is incorrect. It should probably be def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: or similar. But in the current code, it's missing the vals and keys parameters. So that's a bug.\n\nWait, no, looking at the code again, the make_sort_freq function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But inside, it uses hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), and then returns make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So it's hardcoded to use rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. That's probably not intended. The function should allow the user to pass vals and keys, just like make_sort. So the function signature is wrong. It should have vals and keys as parameters, with default values perhaps.\n\nSo the issues I found are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) is incorrect because rasp.indices * -1 is not a valid operation. It should be replaced with a Map that negates each index.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the function signature is incorrect. It should accept vals and keys as parameters, not just max_seq_len. Otherwise, when the function is called with tokens, it's an error.\n\nLet me address each issue.\n\nFor the first issue, in make_sort_unique(), I'll replace rasp.indices * -1 with rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices).\n\nFor the second issue, I'll modify make_sort_freq() to accept vals and keys, with default values set to rasp.tokens. So the function becomes def make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens, keys: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. This way, it can be called with or without specifying vals and keys.\n\nWait, but in the example usage, make_sort_freq is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the first two arguments are vals and keys, and the third is max_seq_len. So the function should have vals, keys, and max_seq_len as parameters, with max_seq_len being a keyword-only argument.\n\nSo the corrected function signature would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the current code, it's defined with only max_seq_len. So that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should have default values for vals and keys, so that it can be called without them. For example:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens, keys: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nThis way, if the user doesn't provide vals and keys, it defaults to rasp.tokens.\n\nSo putting it all together, the changes needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), fix the Select call by using a Map to negate indices.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), correct the function signature to accept vals and keys, and adjust the calls inside to use these parameters instead of rasp.tokens.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor make_sort_unique:\n\n- Change sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) to use a Map.\n\nFor make_sort_freq:\n\n- Change the function signature to include vals and keys with default values.\n- Modify the hist calculation to use keys instead of rasp.tokens.\n- Modify the make_sort call to use vals and the modified keys.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the hist is based on the input tokens, but perhaps it should be based on the keys. Or maybe the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their frequency. So perhaps the hist should be computed on the keys, not on the tokens. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the function's purpose is to sort tokens by their frequency. So the histogram should count how often each token appears in the input. So the keys for make_hist should be rasp.tokens, not the function's keys parameter. So perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the input tokens, regardless of the keys. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to sort the keys based on their frequency in the values. This needs clarification.\n\nBut given the example usage, when make_sort_freq is called with rasp.tokens as both vals and keys, it sorts the tokens based on their frequency. So the hist is computed on the tokens, which are the keys in this case. So in the function, hist is computed as make_hist() which uses rasp.tokens. So if the function is modified to accept vals and keys, perhaps the hist should be computed on the keys. Or perhaps it's better to keep it as rasp.tokens. Hmm, perhaps the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their own frequency, so the keys should be the tokens. So in that case, the function's current approach is correct, but the function signature is wrong because it's missing the parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the keys. But I'm not sure. The example shows that when called with [2,4,2,1], the output is [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency. So the function is correctly computing the histogram of the tokens.\n\nSo, to fix the function signature, I'll add vals and keys as parameters, with default values set to rasp.tokens. Then, inside, compute hist based on keys. Wait, no, because in the example, the keys are the same as the tokens. So perhaps the hist should be computed on the keys. So the line hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") should instead be hist = -1 * make_hist()(keys). Or perhaps I need to compute the histogram of the keys.\n\nWait, no. make_hist() returns an SOp that, when evaluated, gives the histogram of the input tokens. So when you call hist = make_hist(), it's an SOp that, when given a sequence, returns the count of each token in that sequence. So if I want the histogram of the keys, I should pass keys to make_hist. But make_hist() is a function that returns an SOp, so perhaps I need to compute the histogram of the keys by using make_hist()(keys). But I'm not sure how SOps work in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_hist function should take an argument, but in the current code, it doesn't. So perhaps the make_hist function is hardcoded to use rasp.tokens. That might be another issue. Because if I want to compute the histogram of a different SOp, I can't. So perhaps make_hist should be modified to accept an SOp as an argument.\n\nWait, looking back, the make_hist function is defined as def make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:. It uses rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, ...), so it's hardcoded to use tokens. So if I want to compute the histogram of another SOp, I can't use make_hist. That's a problem because in make_sort_freq, I need the histogram of the keys, which might not be tokens.\n\nSo perhaps make_hist should be modified to accept an SOp as an argument, defaulting to rasp.tokens. So the function becomes def make_hist(sop: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens) -> rasp.SOp:. Then, inside, same_tok = rasp.Select(sop, sop, ...). That way, it can be used for any SOp.\n\nBut since the user's task is to repair the given program, perhaps I should focus on the issues I identified earlier.\n\nSo, to sum up, the two main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the Select call uses rasp.indices * -1, which is incorrect. It should be a Map that negates each index.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, the function signature is incorrect, missing vals and keys parameters, leading to a TypeError when called.\n\nSo, I'll proceed to fix these two issues.\n\nFor the first issue, I'll replace the line in make_sort_unique with:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(\n    target_pos,\n    rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices),\n    rasp.Comparison.EQ\n)\n\nFor the second issue, I'll modify make_sort_freq's function signature to include vals and keys with default values, and adjust the hist calculation to use keys if necessary. Wait, no, in make_sort_freq, the hist is based on the tokens, so perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the input tokens regardless of the keys. So the function's current approach is correct, but the function signature is wrong. So I'll add vals and keys as parameters, but in the function, hist is computed based on the input tokens, which is vals. Or perhaps it's based on the keys. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, in the example, when make_sort_freq is called with rasp.tokens as both vals and keys, it sorts the tokens based on their frequency. So the hist is computed on the tokens, which are the vals. So in the function, hist should be computed on the vals. So I'll modify the function to compute hist based on vals.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Change make_sort_freq's signature to accept vals and keys.\n\n- Compute hist as make_hist()(vals).\n\nWait, but make_hist() returns an SOp that, when evaluated, gives the histogram of the input. So to compute the histogram of vals, I need to create an SOp that represents the histogram of vals. So perhaps I should define make_hist to accept an SOp, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a new make_hist function that takes an SOp, but that's beyond the current task.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in make_sort_freq, I can compute the histogram of the keys (which are the tokens) by using make_hist(), which is hardcoded to tokens. So if the function is called with keys as tokens, it's correct. But if keys are different, it's not. So perhaps the function is intended to always use tokens, but the function signature is wrong.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the main issue is the function signature, so I'll fix that first.\n\nSo, in the function make_sort_freq, I'll change the signature to:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nAnd then, inside, compute hist as make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is based on tokens. But if the function is called with different vals and keys, this might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the hist should be based on the keys. So I need to compute the histogram of the keys.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the keys. So in make_sort_freq, the hist is the frequency of each key in the input. So to compute that, I need to create an SOp that counts the occurrences of each key.\n\nBut since make_hist is hardcoded to use tokens, I can't use it for keys. So perhaps I need to create a new selector that compares keys to keys.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, I can compute the histogram as:\n\nhist = rasp.SelectorWidth(rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ)).named(\"hist\")\n\nBut that would give the count of each key in the keys sequence. Wait, no, because Select(keys, keys, EQ) creates a selector where each row i is True for all j where keys[j] == keys[i]. Then SelectorWidth gives the count for each i, which is the number of times keys[i] appears in the entire sequence. So yes, that would give the histogram of the keys.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, instead of using make_hist(), which is for tokens, I should compute the histogram of the keys.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, fix the Select call by using a Map to negate indices.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, correct the function signature to accept vals and keys.\n\n3. In make_sort_freq, compute the histogram based on the keys, not the tokens.\n\nSo, the revised make_sort_freq function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_key = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_key\")\n    hist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_key).named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, hist was multiplied by -1. So I'll apply a Map to negate the hist.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, hist was computed as make_hist(), which is based on tokens. Now, I'm changing it to be based on keys. So the function's behavior might change, but according to the example, it's supposed to sort based on token frequency. So perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the tokens, not the keys. So I'm a bit confused again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their frequency in the input. So the histogram should be computed on the tokens, which are the vals. So in that case, I should compute the histogram of vals.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, I should compute the histogram of vals. So same_val = rasp.Select(vals, vals, EQ), then hist = SelectorWidth(same_val).\n\nSo, the function becomes:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_val = rasp.Select(vals, vals, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_val\")\n    hist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_val).named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(keys, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, no. Because in the example, the function is called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which would sort the tokens based on their frequency. So in this case, vals and keys are both tokens. So the function would compute the histogram of vals (tokens), negate it, and then sort the keys (tokens) based on this negated histogram.\n\nBut in the original code, the function was using hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is based on tokens. So perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the tokens, regardless of the keys. So in that case, the function should compute the histogram of the tokens, which are the vals.\n\nSo, to fix the function, I'll compute the histogram of vals, then proceed as before.\n\nSo, the revised make_sort_freq function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_val = rasp.Select(vals, vals, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_val\")\n    hist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_val).named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(keys, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the function was using make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which suggests that the keys for sorting are the hist, and the vals are the tokens. So perhaps the function should sort the tokens based on the histogram of the tokens.\n\nSo, in the revised function, the keys for make_sort are the negated histogram of the tokens, and the vals are the tokens themselves.\n\nWait, no. The function is supposed to return the tokens sorted by their frequency. So the keys for sorting should be the histogram of the tokens, and the vals to be sorted are the tokens.\n\nSo, in make_sort, the first argument is the vals to sort, and the second is the keys for sorting. So in make_sort_freq, we should pass vals=vals, keys=neg_hist.\n\nWait, no. Because in make_sort, the function returns the vals sorted according to the keys. So if we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency, the keys should be the histogram of the tokens, and the vals are the tokens.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, the call should be make_sort(vals, neg_hist, ...).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function becomes:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_val = rasp.Select(vals, vals, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_val\")\n    hist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_val).named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    sorted_vals = make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the function was using make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which suggests that the keys are the hist, and the vals are the tokens. So in the revised function, it's consistent.\n\nSo, to summarize, the changes are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, fix the Select call to use a Map for negating indices.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, correct the function signature and compute the histogram of vals (tokens) instead of using make_hist, which is hardcoded.\n\nWait, but make_hist is a function that returns the histogram of tokens. So perhaps it's better to reuse make_hist if possible. But since make_hist is hardcoded, perhaps it's better to compute the histogram within make_sort_freq.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should modify make_hist to accept an SOp as an argument. But that's beyond the current task.\n\nSo, the final code would have:\n\n- make_sort_unique corrected.\n\n- make_sort_freq with the correct signature and histogram computation.\n\nI think that's the plan.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 5527, "total_tokens": 10149}}, {"id": "gen-1738411253-fEWjGa3FuktpclDDt985", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411253, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we need to address the incorrect usage of `rasp.indices * -1` in the `make_sort_unique` function.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The sel_new selector is supposed to select the position where the index matches target_pos. Wait, the code uses rasp.indices * -1. Oh, that's a problem because rasp.indices is a sequence, and multiplying by -1 isn't valid. Maybe it should be rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices) instead. That would correctly create negative indices for alignment.\n\nThen, in make_sort(), the function takes max_seq_len and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. That makes sense. But when calling make_sort_unique, it passes the modified keys. So that part seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as the key. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified, which might not be necessary here because the histogram is already unique? Or maybe not. Also, the original make_sort_freq example uses make_sort with three arguments, but the function expects four (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in make_sort_freq, when it calls make_sort, it's missing the min_key argument. That's a problem because it's required.\n\nSo the issues are:\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ) is incorrect because rasp.indices * -1 isn't valid. It should map each index to its negative.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is missing the min_key argument, which is required.\n\nLet me fix these step by step.\n\nFor the first issue, I'll replace rasp.indices * -1 with a Map that negates each index. So sel_new becomes rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices), rasp.Comparison.EQ).\n\nFor the second issue, in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort should include the min_key. Since the function has a default for min_key in make_sort, but looking back, the make_sort function's signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So when calling it, I need to provide min_key. In make_sort_freq, the current call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). Wait, no, looking at the code, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). Oh, wait, no, in the original code, the make_sort_freq function calls make_sort with max_seq_len and min_key. Let me check the original code again.\n\nWait, in the original code, make_sort_freq is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: and inside it calls make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct. So maybe that's not the issue. Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the original code in make_sort_freq is:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut the make_sort function expects four parameters: vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key. So the call is correct because it's passing all required arguments. So perhaps that's not the issue.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about the second issue. Let me check again. The make_sort function is defined with vals, keys, max_seq_len, and min_key. So in make_sort_freq, the call includes all of them. So that's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique with the rasp.indices * -1 part.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_unique, the return is rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). But the Aggregate function requires a default parameter. Looking at the source code, the Aggregate constructor has default=None by default. So in the original code, it's not specified, which is okay because it defaults to None. So that's fine.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort_unique function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). So that's correct.\n\nSo the only issue is in make_sort_unique where rasp.indices * -1 is used, which is invalid. So I need to replace that with a Map that negates each index.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique function should have:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(\n    target_pos,\n    rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, rasp.indices),\n    rasp.Comparison.EQ\n)\n\nThat should fix the problem.\n\nLet me also check if there are any other issues. For example, in make_sort, when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. That seems correct because it's adding a unique value to each key based on their position, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, the hist is calculated as -1 * make_hist(), which gives lower values for higher frequencies, so when sorted, higher frequencies come first. That makes sense.\n\nSo the main correction is in make_sort_unique, fixing the selector to use the correct negative indices.\n\nI think that's the only change needed. Let me summarize the changes:\n\n1.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ comparison and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears by checking equality. So hist should return the frequency of each token. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the count of smaller, which gives the number of keys each position is smaller than. The sel_new selector is supposed to select the correct position to place each value. Wait, the current code uses rasp.indices multiplied by -1. Oh, but rasp.indices gives the position indices, which are 0-based. Multiplying by -1 would make them negative, which might not align with target_pos, which is a count (non-negative). That could be a problem because the EQ comparison would fail. Instead, sel_new should probably use rasp.indices directly. So I think the line should be rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ) or maybe use a different approach to get the correct positions.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term that makes them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That seems correct as long as the modification doesn't interfere with the sorting order beyond ensuring uniqueness.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (frequency) of each token and then uses it as the key for sorting. But it multiplies hist by -1, so higher frequencies come first. Then it calls make_sort with these negative frequencies as keys. Wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq, min_key is set to 1. So the keys would be (-hist) + 1 * i / max_seq_len. This should ensure that tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their position, which is correct. But I need to check if the way make_sort is called here is correct. The function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but in make_sort_freq, it's using 'hist' which is already the frequency. Wait, no, in make_sort_freq, 'hist' is the negative of the frequency. So when passed to make_sort, it's sorted in ascending order because the keys are negative. So tokens with higher frequency (more negative) would come first. But the example shows that [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorting is by frequency descending, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq, the code is written as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But looking at the make_sort function, the parameters are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. That's correct because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nWait, but in the original code, make_sort_freq is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: and inside it calls make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But the make_sort function expects 'vals' and 'keys' as the first two arguments. So in this case, vals is rasp.tokens and keys is hist. That's correct because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nBut looking back at make_sort_unique(), the issue is with sel_new. The current code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBut rasp.indices is a sequence of 0,1,2,... So multiplying by -1 gives -0, -1, -2, etc. Comparing target_pos (which is a count, like 3,2,1,0 in the example) with these negative indices won't work. So the selector will be all False because target_pos is non-negative and rasp.indices * -1 is non-positive. So the Aggregate will return defaults, which is None. That's a bug.\n\nSo to fix make_sort_unique, I need to correct the sel_new selector. Instead of using rasp.indices * -1, I should use rasp.indices. Because target_pos is the number of elements smaller than each key, which corresponds to the position where the element should be placed in a sorted list. For example, if target_pos for an element is 2, it should be placed at index 2.\n\nSo the corrected line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThis way, each element's target_pos is compared to each index, and the selector will select the correct position.\n\nAnother thing to check is in make_sort_freq. The hist is calculated as -1 * make_hist(), which gives the negative frequency. Then, when passed to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the tokens will be ordered from most frequent to least. But wait, make_sort() sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if the key is -frequency, then higher frequencies (which are more negative) will come first. So the sorting is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: if key1 = -freq1 and key2 = -freq2, and freq1 > freq2, then key1 < key2. So when sorted in ascending order, key1 comes before key2, which means the token with higher frequency comes first. That's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique where sel_new is incorrectly using rasp.indices * -1. Fixing that should solve the problem.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, change sel_new to use rasp.indices instead of rasp.indices * -1.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. make_hist seems correct. make_sort seems correct as it modifies the keys to ensure uniqueness. make_sort_freq is correct as it uses the negative histogram as keys.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4622, "completion_tokens": 2126, "total_tokens": 6748}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices * -1, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.2}
