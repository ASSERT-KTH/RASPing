            "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to repair the provided RASP program for the make_sort and make_sort_unique functions. Let me first understand what the current code is doing and why it might not be working correctly.\n\nLooking at make_sort_unique, the goal is to sort the 'vals' based on the 'keys' using the < relation, assuming keys are unique. The current approach creates a 'smaller' selector that selects keys less than each other. Then, using SelectorWidth on this selector gives the target position for each element. The idea is that for each key, the number of keys smaller than it (target_pos) is its position in the sorted order. Then, a selector 'sel_new' is created to match the target_pos with the indices, and Aggregate is used to pick the corresponding val.\n\nWait, let's think about this. Suppose the keys are [3,1,4,2]. For each element, the SelectorWidth(smaller) would count how many keys are smaller than it. So for 3, the count is 1 (since 1 and 2 are smaller). For 1, count is 0. For 4, count is 3 (since 1,2,3). Wait, no. Wait, the 'smaller' selector is created with Select(keys, keys, LT). For each key (as query), the selector's row would have True for every key less than it. So for each element i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys j where keys[j] < keys[i]. That would be the rank of the element if all keys are unique. Then, the target_pos would be the position each element should go to in the sorted array. So if the original keys are [3,1,4,2], then the target_pos for each element would be 2 (since 1 and 2 are smaller than 3), 0 (no elements smaller than 1), 3 (all others are smaller than 4), and 1 (only 1 is smaller than 2). Then, the target_pos would be [2,0,3,1], which would be the indices where each element should go. Then, the sel_new is selecting where target_pos equals the indices. Wait, no. The 'sel_new' is a selector where the keys are target_pos (from the SOp) and the queries are rasp.indices. The predicate is EQ. So for each position i, sel_new[i][j] is True if target_pos[j] == i. Because in the Select, keys are target_pos (so j is varying as the keys, and queries are the indices, which are the positions i. So the selector is True at position (i,j) if target_pos[j] == i. Then, when we aggregate over this selector, for each position i, we collect the vals[j] where target_pos[j] == i. Since keys are unique, each target_pos[j] is unique, so each row of the selector will have exactly one True. Thus, the aggregate would pick the val[j] where j is the element that should be at position i in the sorted order. That makes sense. So the make_sort_unique function should work for unique keys.\n\nBut the problem comes when there are duplicate keys. For example, if two elements have the same key, their target_pos would be the same, leading to multiple True in a row of sel_new. Then, the Aggregate would average them, which is not desired. So the make_sort function is supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique. The original approach in make_sort modifies the keys using a sequence map that combines the original key with the index. The code is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x * min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, this is supposed to add a unique component to each key based on the index. Let's see. For example, if the original keys are [2,4,1,2], the code would modify them by multiplying by min_key and then index/max_seq_len. So min_key is provided as a parameter. Let's say max_seq_len is 5, min_key is 1. Then, for the original key x at index i, the new key is x * 1 * i /5. So the keys become [2*0/5=0, 4*1/5=0.8, 1*2/5=0.4, 2*3/5=1.2]. Wait, but for i=0, it's 0. Then for the first element (original key 2, index 0) the new key is 0. The next element (original key 4, index 1) becomes 4*1/5=0.8. Then, original key 1, index 2: 1*2/5=0.4. Original key 2, index 3: 2*3/5=1.2. Now, these keys are unique. But wait, the original problem is when there are duplicate keys. So the code adds a term that makes each key unique by incorporating the index, scaled by min_key and max_seq_len.\n\nBut the way it's calculated here might not work. Let's see. Suppose original keys are the same. For example, two elements with key x. Their new keys would be x * min_key * i /max_seq_len. But if i is different, then the new keys would differ. But the problem is that x could be zero. Wait, but in the example given, when the original key is 2, index 0: new key is 0. Then, if there's another element with key 0, say, but different index. Then the new key would be 0 * min_key * i /max_seq_len = 0. So duplicates could still occur. So the approach is flawed.\n\nWait, the idea is to create a unique key for each element by combining the original key with the index. But the current formula x * min_key * i /max_seq_len may not ensure uniqueness. For example, if x is zero, then the new key is zero regardless of i. So that would cause duplicates again.\n\nSo the problem with the current code is that the way it's modifying the keys to make them unique is incorrect. So how can we adjust this?\n\nThe documentation says that the make_sort function is supposed to modify the keys to be unique by using max_seq_len and min_key. The original approach might not handle cases where x is zero. So we need a different way to combine the index with the original key to ensure uniqueness.\n\nThe correct approach is to add a small perturbation based on the index, such that even if two original keys are the same, their modified keys are different. For example, adding (i / max_seq_len) * min_key. But how?\n\nWait, min_key is supposed to be the minimum possible key value. Let's say all keys are >= min_key. Then, the perturbation can be (i / max_seq_len) * delta, where delta is a value smaller than the minimal difference between keys. But in reality, since we can't know the differences, perhaps the code should modify the keys in a way that the index is added in a way that doesn't affect the ordering when the original keys are the same, but ensures uniqueness.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is key + (i / max_seq_len) * epsilon, where epsilon is a small value (smaller than the minimal difference between any two keys). But in practice, since we don't know the minimal difference, the code uses min_key (the minimal possible key) and max_seq_len to compute a perturbation that's small enough.\n\nWait, the original code in make_sort was:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x * min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, that multiplies x by min_key, then by i, then divides by max_seq_len. That approach may not work when x is zero. For example, if x is zero, then the new key is zero, regardless of i. So two elements with x=0 would have the same new key. So that's a problem.\n\nInstead, perhaps the perturbation should be additive rather than multiplicative. For example, x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len. Then, even if x is the same, the (i * min_key)/max_seq_len would be different for different i. Since min_key is the minimum key, but in the code's example, when the original keys are [2,4,1,2], the code uses min_key=1, max_seq_len=5. Then, the new keys would be 2 + (0 *1)/5 =2, 4 + (1*1)/5=4.2, 1 + (2*1)/5=1.4, 2 + (3*1)/5=2.6. Now, these are unique. So the ordering is first 1.4 (original 1), then 2, then 2.6 (original 2 at index 3), then 4.2 (original 4). So when sorted, the vals would be ordered as the original 1's val, then the two 2's in their original order (since their new keys are 2 and 2.6). Wait, but if the original keys are [2,2], their new keys would be 2 +0*min_key/max_seq_len and 2 +1*min_key/max_seq_len. So even if the original keys are same, their new keys would be different, and the order would be based on their indices.\n\nSo using an additive approach would work better. That way, even if x is the same, the perturbation (i * delta) where delta is small enough (like min_key / max_seq_len) would ensure that the new keys are unique and that for the same x, the element with a lower index comes first in the sorted order.\n\nSo the problem in the original code is that the formula is x * min_key * i / max_seq_len, which is multiplicative. This doesn't handle x=0. The correct approach should be to add a term based on the index, not multiply. So the line in make_sort should be modified to use an additive term.\n\nSo the fix would be to change the SequenceMap lambda from a multiplicative approach to an additive one. For example:\n\nlambda x, i: x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len\n\nBut wait, min_key is the minimum possible key. But perhaps to ensure that the added term is smaller than the minimal difference between original keys. For example, if the original keys are unique, then the perturbation is small enough to not affect the order. If the original keys are the same, the perturbation would order them based on their index.\n\nWait, but if the original keys are not unique, the added term should break the tie. So for two elements with the same x, their new keys would be x + (i1 * min_key)/max_seq_len and x + (i2 * min_key)/max_seq_len. Since i1 and i2 are different, their new keys are different. And because (i * min_key)/max_seq_len is positive (assuming i is positive, which it is since indices start from 0?), but wait, min_key could be negative? The problem says \"Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\" So perhaps the code assumes that the keys are numerical and that min_key is the minimal possible key. But if min_key is negative, then adding (i * min_key) could decrease the key. But perhaps in the context of the problem, min_key is a positive value. Let's check the example provided:\n\nIn the example usage:\n\nsort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\nsort([2, 4, 3, 1]) \u2192 [1,2,3,4]\nsort([2,4,1,2]) \u2192 [1,2,2,4]\n\nWait, the original code uses min_key=1, which is the minimal key in the input. Wait, in the first example, the minimal key is 1, so that's passed as min_key. But when the input is [2,4,1,2], the min_key is 1. So the code is expecting that min_key is the minimal possible key, which would be the minimal in the input. So when they use make_sort, they have to pass min_key as the minimal key in the input. That's a bit of a problem, but according to the note in the docstring: \"Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\" And the code uses min_key to compute the perturbation.\n\nBut the original code's way of combining x and i (multiplying) is wrong. So changing that to an additive term would fix the problem.\n\nSo in the code for make_sort, the line where keys are modified should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, but what if min_key is negative? For example, if the original keys can be negative, then adding (i * min_key)/max_seq_len could cause the new key to be smaller. However, the code's documentation says that this approach ensures keys are unique. So as long as min_key is the minimal possible key, even if negative, the code would generate unique keys. Let's see: for two elements with the same x, their indices are different, so i differs, and (i * min_key)/max_seq_len would be different. Thus, their new keys would be x + (i1 * min_key)/max_seq_len and x + (i2 * min_key)/max_seq_len, which are different. Thus, the keys become unique.\n\nSo the problem in the original code is the multiplicative approach. So the fix is to replace the multiplication with addition.\n\nTherefore, the correct code for the SequenceMap in make_sort should use x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len.\n\nSo the line in make_sort should be modified from:\n\nlambda x, i: x * min_key * i / max_seq_len\n\nTo:\n\nlambda x, i: x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len\n\nThis way, even if two elements have the same key x, their modified keys will differ based on their indices, ensuring uniqueness. Then, make_sort_unique can handle the keys as unique and sort correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the use of rasp.indices. In RASP, rasp.indices returns the position index of each element. So for a sequence of length n, rasp.indices is [0, 1, ..., n-1]. But in the original code, the lambda uses i (the index) as part of the calculation. However, in the original code, when the code is called with max_seq_len=5 and the actual sequence length is 4, the division by max_seq_len (5) would still work because i is up to 3 (for length 4), so (i * min_key)/max_seq_len is (3*1)/5=0.6. So even if the actual sequence is shorter than max_seq_len, it's okay.\n\nNow, testing with the example provided:\n\nIn the example, the second call is sort([2,4,1,2]), which after modification would have keys:\n\nFor the first element (x=2, i=0): 2 + (0 *1)/5 = 2.0\n\nSecond (x=4, i=1): 4 + (1*1)/5 =4.2\n\nThird (x=1, i=2):1 + (2*1)/5=1.4\n\nFourth (x=2, i=3): 2 + (3*1)/5=2.6\n\nThese keys are [2.0, 4.2, 1.4, 2.6]. The sorted order of keys is 1.4, 2.0, 2.6,4.2. So the original elements are at indices 2, 0, 3, 1. Their vals (which in this case are same as keys) would be sorted as [1,2,2,4], which matches the example.\n\nSo the fix is correct.\n\nNow, let's apply this change to the code. The original make_sort function's keys are modified using a lambda that multiplies x by min_key and i, divided by max_seq_len. Changing that to adding (i * min_key)/max_seq_len.\n\nAnother possible issue is the order of parameters in the SequenceMap. The original code uses keys and rasp.indices as the two SOps. The lambda takes x (from keys) and i (from rasp.indices), which is correct. So the code would need to have:\n\nrasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nThus, in the code for make_sort, changing the lambda in the SequenceMap from multiplication to addition.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort would be:\n\ndef make_sort(...):\n    ...\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (i * min_key) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nThis should fix the issue where duplicate keys were not handled properly.\n\nNow, let's check the make_sort_unique function. The code creates a selector for keys less than each other, then counts how many are smaller (target_pos). Then creates a selector where target_pos equals the indices, and aggregates the vals. That should work as long as the keys are unique, which the modified make_sort ensures.\n\nThus, the main fix is in the make_sort function's SequenceMap lambda."

  "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x * min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block."
