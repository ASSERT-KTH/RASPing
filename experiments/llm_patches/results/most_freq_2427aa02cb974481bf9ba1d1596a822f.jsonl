Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then gets the width. That seems correct. So hist should return the count of each token. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. The current implementation creates a 'smaller' selector using GEQ, which might be incorrect. Wait, if we're sorting in ascending order, we should find where each key is greater than or equal to others, but I'm not sure. Let me think: for each position i, we want to find how many keys are smaller than or equal to key i. Then target_pos would be the count, which is used to select the position. But using GEQ might not be the right approach. Maybe it should be LT instead. Because for sorting, you typically look for elements smaller than the current, not greater. So perhaps the 'smaller' selector should use Comparison.LT. That way, target_pos would give the number of keys less than the current, which can be used for sorting.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on index. That makes sense to break ties. But in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become unique, allowing make_sort_unique to work correctly. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. But wait, when using make_sort(), it's passing hist as the keys. The hist is the count of each token. So when we negate it, lower frequencies come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] has hist [2,1,2,1]. Negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted, the order would be based on these negated values. But the example expects [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). So the current approach should work. But wait, in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using hist as the key, but in the function definition, make_sort takes vals and keys. So in make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. That seems correct because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nWait, but in the example given for make_sort_freq, the output is [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the input is [2,4,2,1]. The hist is [2,1,2,1]. So when we sort the tokens based on their hist (which is the frequency), the tokens with higher frequency come first. So 2 has frequency 2, 4 and 1 have 1. So the sorted order should be 2,2,4,1. But in the current code, hist is negated, so the keys become -2, -1, -2, -1. When sorted in ascending order, the smallest comes first. So the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to the original indices 0,2,1,3. So the sorted tokens would be 2,2,4,1, which matches the example. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut make_sort expects keys to be numerical. Since hist is a count, it's numerical, so that's fine.\n\nBut looking back at make_sort_unique, the issue is with the 'smaller' selector. Let me think again. The function is supposed to return vals sorted by the keys in ascending order. So for each position i in the output, we need to find the element in vals where the key is the i-th smallest.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the code creates 'smaller' as the selector where each row i has True for all j where key[j] >= key[i]. Then target_pos is the sum of each row, which would be the number of keys >= key[i]. So for the smallest key, all other keys are >=, so target_pos would be the total count, which is the length. Then, when we create sel_new as the selector where target_pos equals indices, that would select the position where the count is equal to the index. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to compute for each position i, how many keys are less than or equal to key i. Then, the target position for each element is based on that count. But I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose keys are [3,1,2]. The correct sorted order is [1,2,3]. So for each key, we need to find its position in the sorted list.\n\nUsing the current code in make_sort_unique:\n\nsmaller = Select(keys, keys, GEQ) \u2192 this creates a selector where each row i has True for all j where key[j] >= key[i].\n\nSo for keys [3,1,2], the selector would be:\n\nRow 0 (key 3): all True (since all keys are <=3)\nRow 1 (key 1): only j=1 is True (since 1 is the smallest)\nRow 2 (key 2): j=1 and j=2 are True (since 1<=2 and 2<=2)\n\nSo target_pos is the sum of each row:\n\nRow 0: 3 (all True)\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 2\n\nSo target_pos is [3,1,2].\n\nThen sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). Indices are [0,1,2].\n\nSo for each i, we're looking for j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo for i=0: no j since target_pos is [3,1,2].\ni=1: j=1\ni=2: j=2\ni=3: j=0\n\nWait, but the indices are 0-based. So the selector sel_new will have True at positions where target_pos[j] equals the row index.\n\nSo row 0: j where target_pos[j] ==0 \u2192 none.\nRow 1: j=1\nRow 2: j=2\nRow 3: j=0\n\nBut the output is supposed to be of the same length as input. So for a sequence of length 3, the output would have 3 elements. But in this case, the sel_new would have 4 rows if max_seq_len is 4, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the 'smaller' selector is using GEQ instead of LT. Because if we use LT, then for each i, the selector would be True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. Then target_pos would be the count of elements less than key[i], which is the correct position in the sorted array.\n\nSo let's adjust that. Change the 'smaller' selector to use Comparison.LT instead of GEQ.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line should be:\n\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n\nThen, target_pos would be the number of keys less than key[i], which is the correct rank. Then, when we create sel_new as the selector where target_pos equals indices, it should correctly select the elements in order.\n\nLet me test this with the example keys [3,1,2].\n\nsmaller would be:\n\nRow 0: j where key[j] < 3 \u2192 all (1,2) \u2192 True for j=1,2.\nRow 1: j where key[j] <1 \u2192 none.\nRow 2: j where key[j] <2 \u2192 j=1.\n\nSo target_pos would be [2,0,1].\n\nThen, sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). So for each i, we look for j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\ni=0: j where target_pos[j]==0 \u2192 j=1\ni=1: j where target_pos[j]==1 \u2192 j=2\ni=2: j where target_pos[j]==2 \u2192 j=0\n\nSo the selector would pick vals[1] for position 0, vals[2] for position1, and vals[0] for position2. So the output would be [1,2,3], which is correct.\n\nSo the problem in make_sort_unique is that it's using GEQ instead of LT. Changing that should fix the sorting.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, but when using make_sort, the keys are the negated hist. So the sorting is based on the negated frequency, which would sort from lowest to highest frequency. Wait, no: when you sort in ascending order, lower values come first. So if we have hist as [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1], sorting these in ascending order would arrange them as -2, -2, -1, -1. So the order of indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are modified by adding a term to make them unique. So in cases where multiple elements have the same key, their indices are used to break ties. So the sorting should be stable in that sense.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique using GEQ instead of LT. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, to summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, change the 'smaller' selector to use Comparison.LT instead of GEQ.\n\nLet me update the code accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2923, "total_tokens": 7542}}, {"id": "gen-1738410431-u4qUG7z5VhIkHdPCEFwH", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410431, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the comparison operator was incorrect.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ comparison and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it's counting how many times each token appears by checking equality. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector using GEQ, which might be incorrect. Because if we're sorting in ascending order, we should find elements where the key is less than the current key, not greater or equal. So using GEQ here would select all keys that are greater than or equal, which doesn't help in finding the correct position. Instead, it should use LT or LEQ. For example, using LT would select keys that are less than the current key, allowing us to count how many are smaller and determine the position.\n\nWait, in the current code, 'smaller' is created with GEQ. Then target_pos is the SelectorWidth of 'smaller', which would give the count of keys greater or equal. But when sorting, we want to know how many keys are smaller than the current key to place it correctly. So this is a bug. The comparison should be LT, not GEQ.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique(), the line should be:\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n\nThat way, target_pos will be the number of keys less than each key, which gives the correct insertion point.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). This function modifies the keys to ensure uniqueness by adding a term based on their position. The code looks okay, but I should check if the way it's adding the min_key and index is correct. It uses a lambda that adds x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This should create a unique key by adding a small value based on position, ensuring that keys are unique for sorting. That makes sense.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. But wait, when it returns make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), the hist is negated. So the keys for sorting are the negative histogram counts. That means the tokens with higher frequency (lower negative counts) will come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let me see: the histogram is [2,1,1,1], so hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted in ascending order based on hist, the order would be based on the smallest hist values first. Wait, no. Because when you sort using make_sort, which sorts by the keys in ascending order. So the most negative (smallest) comes first. So tokens with higher frequency have more negative hist, so they appear earlier. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, so higher frequency tokens have lower (more negative) values. So when sorted in ascending order, they come first. That's correct because we want higher frequency tokens to appear earlier.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the output is [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the input is [2,4,2,1]. The histogram is [2,1,1,1]. So hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. The keys are these hist values. So when sorted, the order is based on the keys. The smallest key is -2 (for token 2), then -1 for the others. So the first two tokens (positions 0 and 2) have key -2, so they should come first. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct because the two 2's are first, followed by 4 and 1.\n\nWait, but when using make_sort(), it's sorting the tokens based on their hist keys. So the tokens are sorted in the order of their keys from smallest to largest. So the tokens with key -2 come first, then those with -1. So the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the parameters passed to make_sort(). In make_sort_freq(), it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). Wait, hist is the negative of the histogram. So the keys are negative numbers. But min_key is set to 1, which is positive. That might cause issues because when modifying the keys in make_sort(), it's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if the original keys are negative, adding a positive term could change the ordering.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. So for each key x, it becomes x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq(), the keys are negative, and min_key is 1. So for each position i, we're adding a small positive value. This could potentially make the keys unique, but does it preserve the order correctly?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Because if two tokens have the same frequency (same hist), their keys would be the same before adding the position-based term. So adding the term would make them unique, but the sorting would then be based on the original key plus the term. However, since the original keys are the same, the order would be determined by the added term, which is based on their positions. So tokens with the same frequency would appear in the order of their positions, which is correct according to the problem statement.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the example given is [2,4,2,1], which has hist [2,1,1,1]. So hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When passed to make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding (1 * i)/max_seq_len. Let's say max_seq_len is 4. So for each token:\n\n- Token 2 at position 0: key = -2 + (1*0)/4 = -2.0\n- Token 4 at position 1: key = -1 + (1*1)/4 = -0.75\n- Token 2 at position 2: key = -2 + (1*2)/4 = -1.5\n- Token 1 at position 3: key = -1 + (1*3)/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the keys after modification are: [-2.0, -0.75, -1.5, -0.25]\n\nWhen sorted in ascending order, the order would be:\n\n-2.0 (position 0), -1.5 (position 2), -0.75 (position 1), -0.25 (position 3)\n\nSo the sorted tokens would be [2 (pos0), 2 (pos2), 4 (pos1), 1 (pos3)], which is [2,2,4,1]. That's correct.\n\nSo the code in make_sort_freq() seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the function definition of make_sort_freq(), the parameters are (max_seq_len: int). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(5). So the function expects max_seq_len, which is used in make_sort(). That seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at make_sort(), the function signature is:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in make_sort_freq(), it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So min_key is 1, which is correct because the original keys (hist) are negative, and adding a positive term ensures that the modified keys are unique.\n\nWait, but in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. So if the original keys are negative, adding a positive term will increase them. So the sorting order might change if not handled correctly.\n\nBut in the example, it worked correctly. So perhaps the code is okay.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort_unique(), the 'sel_new' is created with rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ). Then, it's used in Aggregate to select the correct value. But target_pos is a sequence where each element is the count of keys less than the current key. So for each position, it's looking for the index where the count matches, which should be the correct position in the sorted array.\n\nBut when using rasp.Select with EQ, it's creating a selector where each row i has True at the position where rasp.indices equals target_pos[i]. So when aggregated, it picks the value at that position.\n\nWait, but in the current code, 'sel_new' is a selector where each row i selects the column j where j equals target_pos[i]. So when we aggregate, each row i will take the value from column j where j is the target position. That should correctly place each value in its sorted position.\n\nSo the issue is in make_sort_unique() where 'smaller' is using GEQ instead of LT. That's the main bug.\n\nSo to fix the code, I need to change the comparison in make_sort_unique() from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), change the comparison from GEQ to LT. So the 'smaller' selector is created with rasp.Comparison.LT.\n\nAfter making this change, the target_pos will correctly count the number of keys less than each key, allowing the sort to work properly.\n\nI should also check if there are any other issues. For example, in make_sort(), when the keys are modified, the min_key is added as a small value. But in make_sort_freq(), min_key is set to 1. Since the original keys are negative, adding a positive value will make them less negative, which might affect the sorting order. But in the example, it worked correctly because the added term was small enough not to change the order beyond making keys unique.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on the position. This way, when two keys are the same, the one with the smaller index gets a smaller added value, thus appearing earlier in the sorted order.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct because each token's count is the number of times it matches others. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector using GEQ, which might be incorrect. Wait, the intention is to find elements where the key is smaller than others. So using GEQ would select keys that are greater than or equal, which might not be right. Oh, wait, no, the selector is used to find how many keys are smaller or equal, which determines the position. Let me think: for each position i, the number of keys <= keys[i] gives the rank. But since the keys are unique, it should work. But wait, the code uses `rasp.Comparison.GEQ` in `rasp.Select(keys, keys, ...)`. So for each key, it's counting how many keys are >= to it. That would give, for each i, the number of elements >= keys[i]. So the target_pos would be the count, which is the rank. But in sorting, we want the position where each element should go. Hmm, maybe it's correct because if you have keys [2,4,3,1], the counts would be [2,4,3,1] for each element, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, let's take an example. Suppose keys are [3,1,4,2]. For each key, how many are >= to it? For 3: 3,4 \u2192 count 2. For 1: all 4 \u2192 count 4. For 4: only itself \u2192 count 1. For 2: 3,4,2 \u2192 count 3. So target_pos would be [2,4,1,3]. Then, the selector `sel_new` selects positions where target_pos equals indices. So for each i, it's True only if target_pos[i] == i. Then, Aggregate picks the vals where this is true. But in the example, target_pos is [2,4,1,3], so for i=0, target_pos is 2, so it's looking for where target_pos equals 0, which is nowhere. So the output would be [None, None, 3, 1]. That doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the selector works. The 'smaller' selector is created with keys and keys, using GEQ. So for each i, j, it's True if keys[i] >= keys[j]. Then, `SelectorWidth` gives the count for each row, which is the number of elements >= keys[i]. So for a sorted list in ascending order, each element's count would be its position in the sorted list. For example, in [1,2,3,4], the counts would be [4,3,2,1]. So when we create `sel_new` as `Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ)`, it's trying to find for each i, the j where target_pos[i] == j. So for each i, it selects the j where the count equals the index. Then, when we aggregate, each position j will collect the value from i where target_pos[i] == j. So in the example, for j=0, no i has target_pos[i] ==0, so it's None. For j=1, i=2 (target_pos 1), so val is 3. For j=2, i=0 (target_pos 2), val is 1. For j=3, i=1 (target_pos 3), val is 2. So the output would be [None,3,1,2], which is not correct. So the sorting isn't working as intended. \n\nWait, maybe the issue is with how the selector is being used. Perhaps the 'smaller' selector should be using LT instead of GEQ. Let me think again. If 'smaller' is the count of elements less than the current key, then for each i, target_pos[i] would be the number of keys < keys[i]. So for [1,2,3,4], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3]. Then, sel_new would select where target_pos equals indices, which would correctly map each i to its sorted position. So in the original code, using GEQ is incorrect; it should be LT. So in `make_sort_unique`, the line `smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.GEQ)` should be `rasp.Comparison.LT` instead. That would fix the issue.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. This function modifies the keys to ensure uniqueness by adding a term based on their position. The code is `keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)`. Wait, but `rasp.indices` starts at 0. So for the first element, i=0, it adds nothing. But if two keys are the same, the one with higher index will have a slightly higher key, ensuring uniqueness. That makes sense. So this part seems okay.\n\nThen, `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It computes the histogram and negates it to use as keys for sorting. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first. But in the current code, `hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")` is used as the key. Then, it's passed to `make_sort` with `min_key=1`. Wait, but the keys here are the negative histogram counts. So when sorted in ascending order, higher counts (more negative) come first. But in `make_sort`, the keys are being adjusted by adding `min_key * i / max_seq_len`. Since `min_key` is 1, it's adding a small value based on the index. But the original `make_sort` function is designed to sort in ascending order based on keys. So in `make_sort_freq`, using the negative histogram as keys should sort tokens with higher frequency first. But I'm not sure if the way the keys are adjusted is correct. Also, in the example given, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the sorting is based on frequency. So perhaps this part is correct.\n\nWait, but in `make_sort`, the function returns `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. So in `make_sort_freq`, the keys are the negative histogram, which are unique because of the adjustment. So that should work.\n\nBut going back to `make_sort_unique`, the main issue is the use of GEQ instead of LT. So that's the bug to fix.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. In `make_sort_unique`, change the `rasp.Comparison.GEQ` to `rasp.Comparison.LT` in the `rasp.Select` call. This will correctly count the number of keys less than the current key, which determines the target position.\n\n2. Verify that the rest of the functions are correct. `make_hist` seems fine. `make_sort` and `make_sort_freq` should be okay once `make_sort_unique` is fixed.\n\nSo the corrected code would have `make_sort_unique` using LT instead of GEQ.\n\nLet me also check the `make_sort` function's example. After the fix, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector with LT would count for each key how many are smaller. So for 2: 1 (only 1 is smaller). For 4: 3 (1,2,3). For 3: 2 (1,2). For 1: 0. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then, sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices. So for each i, it's looking for j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0: j=3 (target_pos[3]=0). For i=1: j=0. For i=2: j=2. For i=3: j=1. So the aggregate would pick vals[3], vals[0], vals[2], vals[1], resulting in [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the fix is to change GEQ to LT in `make_sort_unique`.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2627, "total_tokens": 7246}}, {"id": "gen-1738410674-lCHUgPfHxUXjG7bdc9Bu", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410674, "choices": [{"error": {"message": "Exception: Chunk too big", "code": 502, "metadata": {"provider_name": "DeepInfra", "raw": {"error_type": "unknown_error", "error_message": "Exception: Chunk too big"}}}, "logprobs": null, "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was incorrectly constructed.

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll check each function one by one.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are greater than or equal to each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys less than or equal to each position. The selector 'sel_new' is then created by selecting where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using this selector. \n\nWait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [4,3,2,1] because each key is compared. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the index. So for index 0, target_pos is 4, which doesn't match. For index 1, target_pos is 3, which doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, the target_pos is the count of keys that are >= to each key. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [4,4,3,1]. Because for the first element (2), all keys are >=2, so 4. For the second (4), all are >=4, so 1? Wait, no, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the 'smaller' selector is created with keys compared using GEQ. So for each key in keys, it's checking against all keys. So for each row i, it's 1's where keys[j] >= keys[i]. So the sum (SelectorWidth) for each row i is the number of keys that are >= keys[i]. So for [2,4,3,1], the rows would be:\n\nRow 0 (key=2): all keys are >=2, so [1,1,1,1] \u2192 width 4.\nRow 1 (key=4): only key 4 is >=4 \u2192 width 1.\nRow 2 (key=3): keys 4 and 3 are >=3 \u2192 width 2.\nRow 3 (key=1): all keys are >=1 \u2192 width 4.\n\nSo target_pos is [4,1,2,4]. Then sel_new is a selector where each row i selects the column where target_pos[i] equals the index. So for row 0, target_pos is 4, so it selects index 3 (since indices are 0-based). For row 1, target_pos is 1, selects index 0. Row 2, target_pos 2, selects index 1. Row 3, target_pos 4, selects index 3.\n\nSo the selector would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 1: [1,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,1,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,1]\n\nWhen we aggregate vals (which are the same as keys in the example) using this selector, each position i will take the value from the selected column. So for output position 0, it's the value where row 1's selector is 1, which is key 4. Wait, no, the aggregation is across the columns for each row. So for each row in the selector, it's selecting one column. So the output will be [4,2,3,1], which is not sorted. Hmm, that's not correct. The example expects [1,2,3,4], but the current code would produce [4,2,3,1]. So there's a bug here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the aggregation works. The Aggregate function takes a selector and an SOP. For each row in the selector, it selects the elements from the SOP where the selector is True and averages them. But in this case, each row has exactly one True, so it's selecting that element. So for row 0, it's selecting column 3, which is 1. Row 1 selects column 0, which is 2. Row 2 selects column 1, which is 4. Row 3 selects column 3, which is 1. So the output would be [1,2,4,1], which doesn't match the example. So clearly, something's wrong with make_sort_unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the selector is built is incorrect. Let me think about the intended logic. The make_sort_unique function is supposed to sort the vals based on the keys in ascending order. So for each position in the output, we need to find the value in vals that corresponds to the key in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'smaller' selector is not correctly identifying the order. Maybe the comparison should be LT instead of GEQ. Let me see: if we use LT, then for each key, we count how many keys are less than it. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then, when we create sel_new as where target_pos equals the index, for each row i, we select the column where target_pos[i] == j. So for row 0, target_pos is 1, so selects index 1. Row 1, target_pos 3, selects index 3. Row 2, target_pos 2, selects index 2. Row 3, target_pos 0, selects index 0.\n\nSo the selector would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0]\n\nAggregating vals [2,4,3,1] would give:\n\nRow 0: selects column 1 \u2192 4\nRow 1: selects column 3 \u21921\nRow 2: selects column 2 \u21923\nRow 3: selects column 0 \u21922\n\nSo the output would be [4,1,3,2], which is still not correct. Hmm, maybe the approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current implementation is not correctly mapping the sorted order. Maybe the way the selector is constructed is incorrect. Let me think about how the RASP paper implements sorting. In the paper, they create a selector where each row i has a single 1 at the position where the ith smallest element is located.\n\nSo for the keys [2,4,3,1], the sorted order is [1,2,3,4], which correspond to the original indices 3,0,2,1. So the selector should be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 1: [1,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [0,1,0,0]\n\nSo when we aggregate, each row i selects the element from the original array at the position indicated by the selector's 1. So for row 0, it selects index 3 \u21921. Row 1 selects index 0 \u21922. Row 2 selects index 2 \u21923. Row 3 selects index 1 \u21924. So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo how do we construct this selector? The current code in make_sort_unique is using a 'smaller' selector with GEQ, which doesn't seem to produce the correct target_pos.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'smaller' selector should be using LT instead of GEQ. Let me try that. So in make_sort_unique, change the comparison to LT.\n\nSo, in make_sort_unique, the line would be:\n\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n\nThen, target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which counts the number of keys less than each key. For [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then, sel_new is where target_pos equals the index. So for each row i, we look for j where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nSo for row 0, target_pos is 1 \u2192 selects index 1.\nRow 1, target_pos 3 \u2192 selects index 3.\nRow 2, target_pos 2 \u2192 selects index 2.\nRow 3, target_pos 0 \u2192 selects index 0.\n\nSo the selector would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0]\n\nWhen we aggregate, each row i will pick the value from the column where the selector is 1. So for row 0, it's column 1 \u21924. Row 1, column 3 \u21921. Row 2, column 2 \u21923. Row 3, column 0 \u21922. So the output is [4,1,3,2], which is still incorrect.\n\nHmm, that's not right. So perhaps the approach of using target_pos and then selecting where target_pos equals the index isn't correct. Maybe we need a different way to construct the selector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code is not correctly handling the order. Maybe instead of using the target_pos as the index, we need to create a selector that for each position in the output, selects the appropriate element from the input.\n\nWait, another approach: for each position i in the output, we want to select the element in the input that is the ith smallest. So for the first position (i=0), we select the smallest element. For i=1, the second smallest, etc.\n\nTo create such a selector, we can for each i, create a condition that counts how many elements are less than the current element and equal to i.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to create a selector where for each output position i, we select the input elements where the number of elements less than or equal to them is greater than i, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current implementation is not correctly aligning the target_pos with the indices. Maybe instead of using rasp.indices, which are 0-based, we should adjust the target_pos to be 1-based or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's think again. For each key in keys, the target_pos is the number of keys less than or equal to it. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3,4,3,1] when using GEQ. Then, when we create a selector where target_pos equals the index, but since indices are 0-based, perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is using the wrong comparison. Let me think about the correct way to compute the rank of each element.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each element how many elements are less than it, which gives its position in the sorted order. So for [2,4,3,1], the counts would be [1,3,2,0]. Then, for each element, its sorted position is its count. So the first element (2) has count 1, so it should be placed at position 1. The fourth element (1) has count 0, so position 0. So the sorted order would be [1,2,3,4], which corresponds to the original indices 3,0,2,1.\n\nSo the selector should have 1's at (0,3), (1,0), (2,2), (3,1). So the selector matrix would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 1: [1,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [0,1,0,0]\n\nTo create this selector, for each row i, we need to select the column j where the count of elements less than keys[i] is equal to i.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i in the output, we want to select the element that is the ith smallest. So for output position 0, we select the smallest element, which is at position 3. For output position 1, the next smallest, which is position 0, etc.\n\nSo the selector should be constructed such that for each output position i, it selects the input position j where the number of elements less than keys[j] is equal to i.\n\nSo to create this, we can compute for each j, the count of elements less than keys[j], which is the rank. Then, for each i, select the j where rank[j] == i.\n\nSo in the code, target_pos is the rank, which is the count of elements less than each key. Then, the selector is created by checking if target_pos[j] == i for each j.\n\nWait, but in the current code, sel_new is created as rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ). So for each row i, it's checking if target_pos[i] equals the index j. So for row i, it's 1's where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nWait, no. The Select function takes two SOPs as keys and queries. So in this case, target_pos is an SOP, and rasp.indices is another SOP. So for each element i in target_pos and each element j in indices, it's checking if target_pos[i] == j.\n\nSo the resulting selector will have 1's where target_pos[i] equals j. So for each row i, it's selecting the column j where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nIn the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for row 0, j=1 \u2192 selects column 1. Row 1, j=3 \u2192 column 3. Row 2, j=2 \u2192 column 2. Row 3, j=0 \u2192 column 0.\n\nSo the selector is:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0]\n\nWhen we aggregate, each row i will take the value from column j where the selector is 1. So for row 0, it's column 1 \u21924. Row 1, column 3 \u21921. Row 2, column 2 \u21923. Row 3, column 0 \u21922. So the output is [4,1,3,2], which is not sorted.\n\nHmm, that's not correct. So the problem is that the selector is not correctly mapping to the desired positions. So perhaps the way the selector is constructed is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the target_pos is not correctly representing the rank. Let me re-examine how target_pos is calculated. The 'smaller' selector is created with keys compared using LT, so target_pos is the count of keys less than each key. So for [2,4,3,1], target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So the ranks are correct.\n\nBut when creating the selector, we're matching target_pos[i] to j (the index). So for each row i, we're selecting the column j where target_pos[i] == j. So for i=0, j=1 is selected. But in the desired selector, for output row 0, we should select j=3.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe instead of using target_pos as the row and comparing to indices, we should create a selector where for each j, if target_pos[j] == i, then select j in row i.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for each output row i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be constructed as a Select where for each i, j is selected if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo in code, that would be rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each i (from indices), we check if target_pos[j] equals i.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the Select function takes keys and queries. So if we want for each i (output row), to select j where target_pos[j] == i, then the keys would be target_pos, and the queries would be i (which is rasp.indices). So the selector would be created as rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ).\n\nWait, but in the current code, it's rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), which would compare target_pos[i] with j. So for each row i, it's checking if target_pos[i] == j. That's not what we want. We want for each row i, to check if target_pos[j] == i for each j.\n\nSo perhaps the code should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWait, no. Because the Select function compares each element of the keys SOP with each element of the queries SOP. So if we pass rasp.indices as keys and target_pos as queries, then for each i (from indices) and j (from target_pos), it's checking if i == target_pos[j]. So the resulting selector will have 1's where i == target_pos[j], which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo in the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for i=0, j=3 (since target_pos[3]=0). For i=1, j=0 (target_pos[0]=1). For i=2, j=2. For i=3, j=1. So the selector would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 1: [1,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [0,1,0,0]\n\nWhich is correct. So the problem in the current code is that the Select is done as (target_pos, indices, EQ), which is the opposite of what it should be.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nshould be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThat way, for each row i (from indices), it's checking if i equals target_pos[j] for each j.\n\nSo that's the bug. The Select is using the wrong order of keys and queries.\n\nLet me check the other functions for similar issues.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it calls make_sort_unique with modified keys. The modification is to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to the keys to make them unique. That seems correct.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), it uses make_hist() to get the histogram, then multiplies by -1 to sort in ascending order of frequency. Then calls make_sort with the modified keys. That seems correct as well.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique, where the selector is constructed incorrectly.\n\nSo to fix the code, I need to change the Select in make_sort_unique to use rasp.indices as the first argument and target_pos as the second.\n\nLet me update that line.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if the other functions have similar issues.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the original code, the 'smaller' selector uses GEQ, which might not be correct. Because if we use GEQ, target_pos would be the count of elements >= each key, which would give a different rank. So perhaps using LT is correct, as it counts the number of elements less than each key, which gives the correct rank for sorting in ascending order.\n\nWait, in the current code, 'smaller' is created with GEQ, which would count the number of elements >= each key. So for [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [4,1,2,4]. Then, when we create sel_new as Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), it would select where target_pos[i] == j. So for row 0, j=4, which is beyond the length, so no selection. That's why the example wasn't working.\n\nSo the correct approach is to change 'smaller' to use LT, and then fix the Select to use indices and target_pos in the correct order.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the code should be:\n\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\ntarget_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWait, no. Because target_pos is an SOP that is the width of 'smaller', which is the count of elements less than each key. So for each key at position i, target_pos[i] is the number of elements less than keys[i]. So for [2,4,3,1], target_pos is [1,3,2,0].\n\nThen, sel_new is created as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). So for each i in indices (0,1,2,3), and each j in target_pos (1,3,2,0), it's checking if i == target_pos[j]. So for j=0, target_pos[j]=1 \u2192 i=1. So row 1, column 0 is 1. For j=1, target_pos[j]=3 \u2192 i=3. So row 3, column 1 is 1. For j=2, target_pos[j]=2 \u2192 i=2. So row 2, column 2 is 1. For j=3, target_pos[j]=0 \u2192 i=0. So row 0, column 3 is 1.\n\nSo the selector becomes:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,1]\nRow 1: [1,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0]\nRow 3: [0,1,0,0]\n\nWhich is correct. So when we aggregate, each row i will select the j where sel_new[i,j] is 1, which is the correct element to place in the output.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique function should have:\n\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\ntarget_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, 'keys' is the SOP, and 'rasp.indices' is another SOP. So when we do Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ), it's comparing each index i to each target_pos[j]. So for each i, j, it's checking if i == target_pos[j]. So the resulting selector will have 1's where i == target_pos[j], which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort_unique is:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, 'smaller' was using GEQ. So changing it to LT is necessary.\n\nSo to summarize, the bugs are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the 'smaller' selector uses GEQ instead of LT.\n2. The Select to create sel_new uses the wrong order of keys and queries.\n\nFixing these should correct the sorting function.\n\nNow, let me check the other functions again.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, it uses make_hist to get the histogram, then multiplies by -1 to sort in ascending order of frequency. Then it calls make_sort with the modified keys. That seems correct.\n\nIn make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. That should work for numerical keys.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique. So I'll correct that function.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the original code, the 'smaller' selector was named, but perhaps it's not necessary, but that's not a bug.\n\nSo the final step is to write the corrected code with these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4628, "completion_tokens": 5856, "total_tokens": 10484}}, {"id": "gen-1738410854-VlHo71xKxkNOcTy1dOLB", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410854, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the comparison operator was incorrect.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then gets the width. That seems correct. The example shows it returns the count of each token, so I think this function is fine.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector using GEQ, which might be incorrect. Because if we're sorting in ascending order, we should find elements where the key is less than the current key, not greater or equal. So using GEQ here would select all keys that are greater or equal, which doesn't help in finding the correct position. Instead, it should use LT or LEQ. Wait, the original implementation in the RASP paper probably uses a different approach. Let me think: to find the position where each element should go, we need to count how many keys are smaller than the current key. So the selector should be where keys are less than the current key. So I should change the comparison from GEQ to LT.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique(), the line should be rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\"). That way, for each position, it counts how many keys are smaller, which gives the target position.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The current code uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But wait, rasp.indices starts at 0, so for the first element, it's 0, which doesn't add anything. Maybe it should start from 1 to ensure all keys are unique. Alternatively, perhaps using rasp.Map to create a sequence of 1/max_seq_len increments. Hmm, but the current approach might not be correct because it's using i, which is 0-based. Let me think: if max_seq_len is 5, then each key is incremented by min_key * i /5. So for i=0, no change. But if two keys are the same, the second one (i=1) will have a slightly higher value. That might work, but perhaps using 1-based index would be better. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct as is because it ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position.\n\nWait, the function make_sort() is called with keys and vals. It then creates new keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x at position i, the new key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that even if two keys are the same, their new keys will be different because i is unique. So this part seems correct.\n\nThen it calls make_sort_unique with these new keys. That should sort the vals based on the modified keys. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. But wait, the hist is computed as the count of each token. So when we negate it, tokens with higher frequency get lower values, which would sort them earlier. But the example shows that [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). So the code uses make_sort with hist negated as the key. But in the current code, make_sort_freq is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but make_sort expects 'keys' to be numerical because it's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. However, hist is a sequence of counts, which are integers. So when we negate them, they become negative integers. Then, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But min_key is set to 1, so for each position i, we add 1 * i / max_seq_len. So for i=0, it's 0, i=1, it's 1/max_seq_len, etc. But the original keys are negative, so adding a small positive value might not be the right approach. Wait, no: the hist is negated, so higher frequencies become more negative. Then, when sorted in ascending order, more negative keys come first, which is correct because we want higher frequency tokens to appear earlier.\n\nBut the issue is that in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding a term that's based on their position. However, the original keys (hist) are negative, and adding a small positive value (since i starts at 0) might not correctly order them, especially if the hist values are the same. For example, two tokens with the same frequency (hist) will have their keys adjusted by their position. So the first occurrence will have a smaller adjustment, making its key less than the second, thus appearing earlier in the sorted output. This maintains the relative order for tokens with the same frequency, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the example given, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1]. The hist for 2 is 2, 4 is 1, 1 is 1. So hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort, the keys are:\n\nFor each position i (0-based), key = -2 + 1*0/5 = -2\ni=1: -1 + 1*1/5 = -0.8\ni=2: -2 + 1*2/5 = -1.6\ni=3: -1 + 1*3/5 = -0.4\n\nSo the keys are [-2, -0.8, -1.6, -0.4]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be:\n\n-2 (i=0), -1.6 (i=2), -0.8 (i=1), -0.4 (i=3). So the sorted indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the function make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. So the function is correctly using the tokens as the values to be sorted, with the keys being the negated histogram counts adjusted by position.\n\nBut wait, looking back at make_sort(), the function signature is:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, when we call make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), that's correct because vals is the tokens, and keys is the hist.\n\nWait, no. Because in make_sort_freq, we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency. So the keys should be the histogram counts, and the values are the tokens. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified to ensure uniqueness. So for tokens with the same frequency, their keys will be adjusted by their position, ensuring that the first occurrence comes before the second. This maintains the original order for ties, which is correct.\n\nSo what's the problem? The user says the program is incorrect and needs repair. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back, in make_sort_unique(), the initial code uses GEQ, which is incorrect. I think that's the main issue. Because to find the target position, we need to count how many keys are smaller than the current key. So the selector should be where keys are less than the current key, not greater or equal.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique(), changing the comparison from GEQ to LT should fix the sorting issue.\n\nLet me test this. Suppose keys are [2,4,3,1]. The correct sorted order is [1,2,3,4]. Let's see what happens with the original code.\n\nOriginal code in make_sort_unique():\n\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.GEQ).named(\"smaller\")\n\nSo for each key, it's selecting all keys that are greater or equal. So for key=2, it selects 2,4,3. So target_pos would be 3. But in the correct sorting, 2 should be at position 1 (0-based index 1). So using GEQ is causing the target_pos to be too high.\n\nIf we change to LT, then for key=2, it selects keys less than 2, which is only 1. So target_pos is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique() using GEQ instead of LT. That's the bug.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), change the comparison from GEQ to LT.\n2. Ensure that all other functions are correct.\n\nLet me check the other functions again.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are modified correctly to ensure uniqueness, which is necessary for make_sort_unique().\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the approach is correct as it negates the histogram and sorts based on that.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique().\n\nNow, I'll update the code accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2793, "total_tokens": 7412}}, {"id": "gen-1738410955-PcujfzERijupGyAtad0r", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410955, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified that the `make_sort_unique` function incorrectly used `Comparison.GEQ` when it should have used `Comparison.LT` to properly determine the order.

Let me think: to find all keys that are less than the current key, we should use Comparison.LT. So the 'smaller' selector should be created with Comparison.LT, not GEQ.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. That makes sense. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the original code, the 'smaller' selector in make_sort_unique is using GEQ, which is wrong. So after fixing make_sort_unique, this function should work as intended.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it so that higher frequencies come first. Then it uses make_sort with hist as keys. But since make_sort_unique was incorrect before, this would have been affected. Once make_sort_unique is fixed, this should work. Also, in make_sort_freq(), the parameters passed to make_sort are correct: tokens as vals, hist as keys, and the max_seq_len.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique() where the 'smaller' selector uses GEQ instead of LT. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), when creating the new keys, it uses SequenceMap with lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures each key is unique by adding a small value based on position. That should handle ties correctly.\n\nTesting the example: for [2,4,3,1], after sorting, it should be [1,2,3,4]. With the corrected 'smaller' selector, the target_pos should correctly find the position where each element should go.\n\nI should also ensure that all functions are using the correct RASP operations and that there are no syntax errors. For example, in make_sort_unique, sel_new is created with Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), which is correct because we're selecting the position where the target index matches the current index.\n\nSo, the key fix is changing the Comparison in make_sort_unique from GEQ to LT.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1362, "total_tokens": 5981}}, {"id": "gen-1738411001-ne4KD4Bgv1MiNP5QBPIX", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411001, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the predicate used was incorrect.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to create a selector and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector using GEQ, which might be incorrect. Because if we're sorting in ascending order, we should select elements where the key is less than the current key, not greater or equal. So using GEQ here would select all keys that are greater or equal, which doesn't make sense for finding the position to place each element. Instead, it should use LT or LEQ. Wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4]. So for each position, we need to find how many keys are smaller than the current key. So the selector should be based on keys being less than the current key. So the predicate should be Comparison.LT, not GEQ. That's a bug.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique(), the line where 'smaller' is created should use rasp.Comparison.LT instead of GEQ. Because GEQ would give True for keys greater or equal, which isn't what we want for sorting in ascending order.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. But wait, the indices start from 0. So for the first element, i=0, it adds nothing. But when there are duplicate keys, this would make them unique by adding a small value based on their position. That makes sense. So this part seems okay.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. But when using make_sort(), it passes hist as the keys. Wait, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(), which gives lower values for more frequent tokens. So when sorted in ascending order, more frequent tokens come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should become [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the histogram is [2,1,1,1], so negated it's [-2,-1,-1,-1]. The keys for sorting would be these negated values. So when sorted, the most negative (i.e., most frequent) comes first. But in the current make_sort(), the keys are being adjusted by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Wait, but in make_sort_freq(), when calling make_sort, the keys are the negated histogram, and vals are rasp.tokens. So the function should sort the tokens based on their frequency, but in case of ties, the original order is preserved. But I'm not sure if the current implementation correctly handles this because the way keys are modified might not preserve the original order when frequencies are the same.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the keys are the negated histogram. So when two tokens have the same frequency, their keys are the same. Then, in make_sort(), the keys are further modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for tokens with the same frequency, their keys become x + i * min_key / max_seq_len. Since i is their position, this ensures that in case of ties, the token that appears earlier comes first. So that should maintain the original order for tokens with the same frequency. So that part seems correct.\n\nBut going back to make_sort_unique(), the main issue is the predicate in the 'smaller' selector. It's using GEQ, which is wrong. Let me think about how the sorting works. The idea is that for each position, we count how many keys are smaller than the current key. Then, the target_pos is that count. Then, we create a selector where the target_pos equals the indices, and aggregate the values. So for each element, we find the position where it should be placed based on how many elements are smaller than it.\n\nSo, in the 'smaller' selector, we need to select all keys that are less than the current key. Therefore, the predicate should be Comparison.LT, not GEQ. Using GEQ would count how many keys are greater or equal, which would not give the correct target position.\n\nSo the fix is to change the predicate in make_sort_unique() from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me check the example given in make_sort_unique(). When keys are [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector with GEQ would not work as intended. For each key, it counts how many keys are >= to it. So for key 2, how many keys are >=2? 2,4,3, so 3. But that's not correct because we need to find how many are smaller. So using LT would give the correct count.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique() should have 'smaller' defined with Comparison.LT.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are modified to ensure uniqueness. But in make_sort_unique(), the function assumes that all keys are unique. So when we pass the modified keys from make_sort() to make_sort_unique(), it should work correctly.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort_unique(), changing the predicate from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any issues. In make_sort_freq(), when creating the keys, it's using the negated histogram. But the way it's called, the min_key is set to 1. So the keys become hist + i * 1 / max_seq_len. Wait, no: in make_sort(), the keys are modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So when x is the negated histogram, adding a small value based on position ensures that earlier tokens in case of ties get a slightly smaller key, so they come first when sorted in ascending order. That makes sense.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique(), fixing the predicate.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2071, "total_tokens": 6690}}, {"id": "gen-1738411071-eil3f40zkMzbJJ4sXMUg", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411071, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was using the wrong comparison operator.

The function modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. But wait, the way it's used in make_sort_freq() might be incorrect. Let me check the make_sort_freq() function. Oh, wait, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated and used as keys. Then make_sort() is called with hist as keys. But in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. However, the original keys (hist) are already being used, and adding this term might not correctly break ties. Also, the way the keys are adjusted might not be correctly handling the sorting order.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is multiplied by -1 so that higher frequencies come first. Then, when sorted, the tokens are ordered by frequency. But when there's a tie in frequency, the original order should be preserved. The current approach in make_sort() might not handle this correctly because it's adding a term based on the index, which could interfere with the sorting order when frequencies are the same.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is in how the keys are being adjusted in make_sort(). Let me think: when two keys have the same value, adding a small value based on their index would make them unique. But if the original keys are negative hist, then adding a term that increases with index would actually make the keys for later positions larger, which might not preserve the original order when sorted in ascending order. Wait, because when you sort, you want the earlier occurrences to come first. So for the same frequency, the token that appears earlier should have a smaller key after adjustment. So perhaps the adjustment should be such that earlier indices have smaller added values. But in the current code, it's x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for i=0, it's x, i=1, x + min_key/ max_seq_len, etc. So when sorted in ascending order, the earlier indices would come first, which is correct. So maybe that part is okay.\n\nWait, but in make_sort(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key). So the keys are the hist, and then modified. But in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, so the keys are -hist. So when we sort using these keys, the tokens with higher hist (more frequent) will have smaller keys (because of the negation), so they come first. That's correct.\n\nBut let's go back to make_sort_unique(). The 'smaller' selector is using GEQ, which is wrong. It should be LT. Because for each position i, we want to select all positions j where key[j] < key[i]. Then, target_pos is the count of such j's, which gives the number of elements smaller than key[i]. Then, sel_new selects the position where the index equals target_pos, which would be the correct position to place the current element. So changing the predicate to LT should fix the sorting issue.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys). But in the original code, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So the keys are unique, allowing make_sort_unique to work correctly.\n\nWait, but in the example given for make_sort_freq(), when the input is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1]. So negated hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Let's say max_seq_len is 4 and min_key is 1. So for each position i (0-based), the key becomes:\n\nFor i=0: -2 + 1*0/4 = -2\ni=1: -1 + 1*1/4 = -0.75\ni=2: -2 + 1*2/4 = -1.5\ni=3: -1 + 1*3/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the keys after modification are [-2, -0.75, -1.5, -0.25]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be:\n\n-2 (i=0), -1.5 (i=2), -0.75 (i=1), -0.25 (i=3)\n\nSo the sorted indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo the adjustment seems to work. But I need to make sure that the way the keys are modified doesn't interfere with the sorting order when the original keys are the same.\n\nAnother possible issue is in make_sort_unique(). The 'smaller' selector is created with keys and keys, using GEQ. That would select all j where key[j] >= key[i]. The target_pos is the count of such j's. So for each i, target_pos is the number of elements >= key[i]. Then, sel_new selects the position where index equals target_pos. But if the predicate is GEQ, then for each i, target_pos would be the number of elements >= key[i]. So when you aggregate, you're selecting the element at position target_pos, which might not be correct for sorting.\n\nWait, let's think about how make_sort_unique() is supposed to work. The idea is to find, for each position i, how many elements are smaller than key[i]. Then, the target position for i is that count. So for example, if the keys are [3,1,2], then for i=0 (key=3), there are 2 elements smaller, so target_pos is 2. So the element at position 0 should be moved to position 2. For i=1 (key=1), target_pos is 0, so it moves to position 0. For i=2 (key=2), target_pos is 1, so it moves to position 1. The result is [1,2,3].\n\nBut in the current code, 'smaller' is using GEQ, which counts the number of elements >= key[i]. So for key[i] = 3, it would count all elements (3,1,2) that are >= 3, which is just 1. So target_pos would be 1. Then, the element at i=0 would be placed at position 1. But that's not correct because 3 should be the last element.\n\nSo clearly, using GEQ is wrong here. It should be LT, so that 'smaller' counts the number of elements less than key[i]. So I need to change the predicate in make_sort_unique() from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me correct that. So in make_sort_unique(), the line should be:\n\nsmaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n\nThat should fix the sorting order.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if min_key is not 1? Or if the keys are not numeric? Well, the function's note says it only works for numerical keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is multiplied by -1, which is correct because higher frequencies should come first. But when we pass this to make_sort(), which then modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len, does that affect the sorting correctly? Let me see: the hist is negated, so the keys are -hist. Then, in make_sort(), these keys are adjusted by adding a small value based on index. So for the same hist value, the earlier indices will have smaller adjusted keys, so they will be sorted first, which preserves the original order. That's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique() using GEQ instead of LT. Fixing that should resolve the incorrect sorting.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any possible issues. In make_hist(), everything seems correct. The Selector is correctly created with EQ, and SelectorWidth gives the count.\n\nIn make_sort(), the function seems okay once make_sort_unique is fixed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), change the predicate from GEQ to LT.\n2.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then gets the selector width. That seems correct. So hist should return the count of each token. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector using GEQ, which might be incorrect. Wait, if we're sorting in ascending order, we should find where each key is less than others. So using GEQ here would give us the count of keys greater than or equal, which doesn't seem right. Maybe it should be LT instead of GEQ. Because for each position, we want to count how many keys are smaller than the current key. Oh wait, no, because in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4]. So for each key, we need to find how many keys are less than it. So the selector should be where keys are less than the current key. So the predicate should be LT, not GEQ. So that's a bug. So in make_sort_unique, the 'smaller' selector is using GEQ, which is wrong. It should be LT.\n\nThen, target_pos is the selector width of 'smaller', which would give the number of keys less than each key. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0], which when used in sel_new with EQ would pick the correct positions. So the problem is that 'smaller' is using GEQ instead of LT.\n\nSo I need to change the predicate in make_sort_unique from GEQ to LT.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. That seems okay. Then it calls make_sort_unique with the modified keys. So that part should be fine once make_sort_unique is fixed.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. Wait, when you negate the histogram, the tokens with higher frequency will have lower values, so when sorted in ascending order, they'll come first. But the example given is [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The keys would be [-2, -1, -2, -1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these keys. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using hist as the keys. But in the current code, it's written as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nmake_sort_freq() defines hist as -1 * make_hist(), then returns make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the keys are the negative histogram. So when sorted in ascending order, tokens with higher frequency come first. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the input is [2,4,2,1]. The histogram is [2,1,2,1]. So hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So the keys are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. When sorted, the order is based on these keys. So the sorted indices would be [1,3,0,2] because -1 is smaller than -2? Wait no, because -1 is larger than -2. So when sorted in ascending order, the keys would be ordered from smallest to largest. So the keys are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. The sorted order would be indices where the key is smallest first. So the order would be 0 (-2), 2 (-2), 1 (-1), 3 (-1). So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo that part seems okay.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key). But looking at the parameters, make_sort expects (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys, which is correct because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique where the predicate is GEQ instead of LT.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_unique, the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). But according to the RASP rules, Aggregate should have a default of None. In the current code, it's not specified, so it's using the default None. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nreturn rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nYes, the default is None, which is correct.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort_unique, changing the predicate from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other issues.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. That should ensure uniqueness as long as max_seq_len is sufficient. So that seems okay.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1, which is fine.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique, changing the predicate in the Select call from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1991, "total_tokens": 6610}}, {"id": "gen-1738411262-gxPBjoKzeDr3g4E0m8ew", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411262, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main correction was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the comparison predicate was incorrect.

Because if we're sorting in ascending order, we should select elements where the key is less than the current key, not greater or equal. So using GEQ here would select all keys that are greater or equal, which doesn't help in finding the correct position. Instead, it should use LT or LEQ. Let me think: to find how many keys are smaller than each key, we should use LT. So the selector should be rasp.Comparison.LT.\n\nThen, target_pos is the count of smaller keys, which gives the position where each element should be placed. The selector for aggregation is where target_pos equals the indices. That part seems okay. So the main issue is the 'smaller' selector using GEQ instead of LT.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position.

Wait, the parameters in make_sort are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). In make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which is correct because vals are the tokens and keys are the hist. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, looking back at make_sort_unique(), the 'smaller' selector is using GEQ, which is wrong. Let me correct that. So in make_sort_unique, I should change the predicate from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me also check the example in make_sort_unique. Suppose keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector with GEQ would select all keys greater or equal, which would give the count as [3,3,2,0]. But for sorting, we need the count of keys less than the current key. So using LT would give [0,1,2,3], which when used as target_pos, would correctly place each element.\n\nSo the fix is to change the predicate in make_sort_unique from GEQ to LT.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated so that higher frequencies come first.

For example, in make_sort, the keys are being modified correctly.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique. I'll correct the predicate in the 'smaller' selector from GEQ to LT.\n\nLet me write down the corrected functions:\n\nIn make_sort_unique, change the predicate to LT.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq, the function parameters were incorrect in the original code. The original code had make_sort_freq defined with three parameters, but in the function, it's using max_seq_len. Wait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut the function signature is correct. It takes max_seq_len as an argument.\n\nWait, no, in the original code, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: which is correct.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort_unique.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, change the predicate from GEQ to LT.\n2. Ensure all other functions are correct.\n\nTesting the example after the fix: for keys [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector with LT would count how many keys are less than each key.\n\nFor key 2: how many keys are less than 2? Only 1, so target_pos for 2 is 1.\n\nFor key 4: how many keys are less than 4? 2,3,1, so target_pos is 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The 'smaller' selector is keys compared to keys with LT. So for each position i, it counts how many keys j are less than key i.\n\nSo for [2,4,3,1]:\n\n- For i=0 (key=2), count of keys <2 is 1 (only key at i=3).\n- For i=1 (key=4), count is 3 (keys 2,3,1).\n- For i=2 (key=3), count is 2 (keys 2,1).\n- For i=3 (key=1), count is 0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then, the selector for aggregation is where target_pos equals indices.\n\nIndices are [0,1,2,3].\n\nSo for each position in the output:\n\n- Position 0: selects elements where target_pos ==0 \u2192 only i=3. So val is 1.\n- Position 1: selects i=0. Val is 2.\n- Position 2: selects i=2. Val is3.\n- Position3: selects i=1. Val is4.\n\nSo the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nThus, the fix in make_sort_unique should resolve the issue.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2040, "total_tokens": 6659}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.GEQ).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
