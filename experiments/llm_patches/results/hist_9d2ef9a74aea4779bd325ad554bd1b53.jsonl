The original code incorrectly used a predicate that checked for inequality, which led to incorrect counts. By using the equality predicate instead, we can accurately count the occurrences of each token.\n\n### Approaches\nThe approach involves using the `rasp.Select` function with an equality check to identify matching tokens. The `rasp.SelectorWidth` function is then used to count these matches, giving the number of occurrences for each token.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a selector that is True where tokens are equal\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ\n    ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    \n    # Count the number of True values in each row of the selector\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Selector Creation**: The `rasp.Select` function is used with `rasp.Comparison.EQ` to create a selector matrix where each element (i, j) is True if the i-th token equals the j-th token.\n2. **Counting Occurrences**: The `rasp.SelectorWidth` function counts the number of True values in each row of the selector matrix, which corresponds to the number of times each token appears in the input sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts token occurrences using RASP's built-in operations, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the RASP program provided. Let me look at the code and understand what it's trying to do.\n\nThe function make_hist() is supposed to return the number of times each token occurs in the input. For example, when given \"abac\", the output should be [2, 1, 2, 1]. \n\nLooking at the current implementation:\n\nsame_tok is created using rasp.Select with rasp.tokens for both keys and queries, and the predicate is NEQ. So this selector will be True where tokens are not equal. Then, SelectorWidth is applied to same_tok, which counts the number of True values in each row.\n\nWait, but if same_tok is NEQ, then SelectorWidth counts how many tokens are different from each token. That's not what we want. We want to count how many times each token appears in the entire sequence.\n\nSo the issue is that the current selector is checking for inequality, which gives the opposite of what's needed. Instead, we should use EQ to find matching tokens.\n\nLet me think about how the Select function works. When we use EQ, each row i will have True in the columns where the token is equal to the i-th token. So the selector will have True where tokens are the same. Then, SelectorWidth will count how many times each token appears, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo the mistake is using NEQ instead of EQ. I should change the predicate from Comparison.NEQ to Comparison.EQ.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly. Replace NEQ with EQ in the Select call. That should fix the issue.\n\nTesting this with the example: for input \"abac\", the tokens are ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c']. \n\nThe selector with EQ will have:\n- Row 0: True, False, True, False \u2192 count 2\n- Row 1: False, True, False, False \u2192 count 1\n- Row 2: True, False, True, False \u2192 count 2\n- Row 3: False, False, False, True \u2192 count 1\n\nWhich gives [2,1,2,1], as desired.\n\nSo the corrected code should use EQ. I'll update the predicate and test it.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3998, "completion_tokens": 835, "total_tokens": 4833}}, {"id": "gen-1738330550-SqtCPP9ohQ8ure6EMuUU", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738330550, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, we need to correctly count the occurrences of each token by using the equality comparison.\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a selector that is True where tokens are equal\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    # Count the number of True values in each row of the selector\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n```", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to repair this RASP program. Let me look at the code provided. The function make_hist() is supposed to return the number of times each token occurs in the input. The example given is that hist(\"abac\") should return [2, 1, 2, 1]. \n\nLooking at the current implementation, it uses rasp.Select with rasp.Comparison.NEQ. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because NEQ would select where tokens are not equal, which would give a selector that's True where tokens are different. But then, when we take the SelectorWidth, that would count how many tokens are different from each token in the sequence. That's the opposite of what we want for a histogram.\n\nSo, the problem is that the current code is counting the number of tokens that are not equal to each position, which isn't the same as the frequency of each token. For example, in \"abac\", the first 'a' would have how many tokens not equal to it? Let's see: the string is a, b, a, c. For the first a (index 0), the other tokens are b, a, c. So, the selector would be checking if each token is not equal to a. So, the selector for index 0 would be [False, True, False, True], because the tokens at indices 1 and 3 are not 'a'. So the width would be 2. But in the example, the first element should be 2 because 'a' appears twice. So the current code is giving 2 for the first token, which matches, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no. The current code is using NEQ, so the selector is True where tokens are not equal. So for each row i, the selector counts how many tokens are not equal to token i. Then, the SelectorWidth would be the count of True in each row. So for the first token 'a', the selector would have True for tokens that are not 'a'. In \"abac\", the tokens are a, b, a, c. So for the first token (a), the selector would be [False, True, False, True], because the second and fourth tokens are not 'a'. So the width is 2. But the actual count of 'a's is 2. So in this case, it's correct. Wait, but that's a coincidence. Because the total number of tokens is 4, and the count of non-equal is 2, which is 4 - 2 = 2, which is the correct count. Hmm, maybe that's why it's working for this example.\n\nWait, let me think again. The current code creates a selector where same_tok is True where tokens are not equal. Then, SelectorWidth gives the count of True in each row. So for each position i, it's counting how many tokens are different from token i. But the histogram should count how many times token i appears in the entire sequence. So these are two different things.\n\nWait, no. Let me take another example. Suppose the input is \"aaaa\". The current code would create a selector where all are False because all tokens are equal. So the SelectorWidth would be 0 for each position. But the histogram should be [4,4,4,4]. So the current code is incorrect because it's returning 0 instead of 4.\n\nSo the problem is that the current implementation is using NEQ, which is the opposite of what we need. We need to count how many times each token appears, so we should be using EQ instead of NEQ.\n\nSo the fix is to change the predicate from Comparison.NEQ to Comparison.EQ. That way, the selector will be True where tokens are equal, and SelectorWidth will count the number of True in each row, which is the frequency of each token.\n\nLet me test this with the example \"abac\". The tokens are a, b, a, c. For each position:\n\n- Position 0: token is 'a'. The selector will be True for positions where token is 'a', which are 0 and 2. So width is 2.\n- Position 1: token is 'b'. Only position 1 is 'b', so width is 1.\n- Position 2: token is 'a'. Again, positions 0 and 2, width 2.\n- Position 3: token is 'c'. Only position 3, width 1.\n\nSo the output would be [2,1,2,1], which matches the example.\n\nAnother test case: \"aaaa\" would give [4,4,4,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the mistake in the original code was using NEQ instead of EQ. Changing that should fix the issue.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3998, "completion_tokens": 1162, "total_tokens": 5160}}, {"id": "gen-1738330581-B3hKSDB0w8vXIwSmlnCL", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738330581, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, we need to correctly count the occurrences of each token in the input sequence.

Let me look at the code and understand what it's supposed to do.\n\nThe function make_hist() is intended to return the number of times each token occurs in the input. The example given is that for input \"abac\", the output should be [2, 1, 2, 1]. Let's see how the current code works.\n\nThe current code creates a selector called same_tok using rasp.Select with rasp.tokens for both keys and queries, and the predicate is Comparison.NEQ. Then it returns the SelectorWidth of same_tok.\n\nWait, let me think about what this does. The Select function creates a matrix where each element (i,j) is True if tokens[i] != tokens[j]. So same_tok is a selector where each row i has True for all j where token j is different from token i.\n\nThen, SelectorWidth(same_tok) counts the number of True values in each row. So for each position i, it's counting how many tokens are different from tokens[i]. \n\nBut the desired output is the count of each token. For example, in \"abac\", the first token 'a' appears at positions 0 and 2, so the count is 2. The second token 'b' appears once, the third 'a' is another occurrence, and the fourth 'c' appears once. So the output is [2,1,2,1].\n\nBut the current code is counting the number of tokens that are different, not the same. So for each position i, it's (length of sequence - 1 - count of same tokens). Because the total tokens is len(tokens), and same_tok counts the different ones.\n\nWait, let's take the example. For \"abac\", which has length 4. For the first token 'a', same_tok's row would have True for j=1 and j=3 (since tokens[1] is 'b' and tokens[3] is 'c'), so the count is 2. So SelectorWidth would return 2 for the first position. But the desired count is 2, which is the number of 'a's. So in this case, the current code is giving 2, which is correct. Wait, no, because the count is the number of different tokens, which is 2, but the total tokens is 4, so the number of same tokens would be 4 - 1 (itself) - 2 (different) = 1. Wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. For each row i in the selector, same_tok is True where tokens[j] != tokens[i]. So the count for row i is the number of tokens that are different from tokens[i]. So the number of same tokens would be (total tokens - 1) - count, because total tokens is len(tokens), subtract 1 (because j can't be i, since tokens[i] == tokens[i] is False in same_tok), and then subtract the count of different tokens.\n\nWait, no. Let's take the example:\n\nInput: \"abac\" \u2192 tokens = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c']\n\nFor i=0 (token 'a'):\nsame_tok row 0 is [False, True, False, True] because tokens[0] == tokens[0] is False, tokens[0] != tokens[1] is True, tokens[0] != tokens[2] is False, tokens[0] != tokens[3] is True. So the count is 2 (True values). So same_tok's width is 2.\n\nBut the number of 'a's is 2. So the current code is returning 2 for the first position, which is correct. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, no. Because same_tok is using NEQ, so it's counting the number of tokens that are different. So for i=0, same_tok's row has 2 Trues, meaning two different tokens. But the total tokens is 4, so the number of same tokens is 4 - 1 (itself) - 2 (different) = 1. But that's not matching the example.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-express the selector.\n\nThe selector same_tok is created with predicate NEQ, so each element (i,j) is True if tokens[i] != tokens[j]. So for each row i, the number of True values is the count of tokens that are different from tokens[i], including all positions except j where tokens[j] == tokens[i].\n\nSo for the example, for i=0, tokens[0] is 'a'. The tokens that are different are at positions 1 ('b') and 3 ('c'), so same_tok's row 0 has two Trues. So SelectorWidth is 2. But the desired count is 2, which is the number of 'a's. So how does 2 (from same_tok's width) relate to the count of 'a's?\n\nWait, perhaps the current code is incorrect because it's using NEQ instead of EQ. Because if we use EQ, then same_tok would have True where tokens[i] == tokens[j]. Then, the width would be the count of tokens equal to tokens[i], including itself. So for i=0, same_tok's row would have True at j=0 and j=2, so width is 2. That's correct because 'a' appears twice.\n\nSo the problem is that the current code uses NEQ, which counts the number of different tokens, but we need to count the number of same tokens. So the fix is to change the predicate from NEQ to EQ.\n\nSo in the code, same_tok is created with rasp.Comparison.NEQ. We should change that to EQ.\n\nLet me adjust that. So the corrected code would be:\n\nsame_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n\nThen, SelectorWidth(same_tok) would give the count of each token, including itself. So for each position i, it's the number of times tokens[i] appears in the sequence.\n\nTesting this with the example:\n\nInput \"abac\" \u2192 tokens = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c']\n\nsame_tok's rows:\n\nRow 0: [True, False, True, False] \u2192 count 2\nRow 1: [False, True, False, False] \u2192 count 1\nRow 2: [True, False, True, False] \u2192 count 2\nRow 3: [False, False, False, True] \u2192 count 1\n\nSo the output is [2,1,2,1], which matches the desired example.\n\nTherefore, the error in the original code was using NEQ instead of EQ.

So for each row i, the count is the number of tokens not equal to tokens[i]. \n\nFor i=0 (token 'a'), the row would be [False, True, False, True], because tokens[0] is 'a', so it's equal to itself (False), 'b' is different (True), 'a' is same (False), 'c' is different (True). So the count is 2. But in the example, the output is 2 for the first 'a', which is correct. Wait, but that's because the count is 2, but that's the number of different tokens. Wait, no, in the example, the output is [2,1,2,1], which is the count of each token. So for 'a' at position 0, there are two 'a's in the input. So the correct count is 2.\n\nWait, but using NEQ, the count would be the number of tokens not equal to 'a', which is 2 (positions 1 and 3). So the SelectorWidth would return 2 for the first row. But that's the count of different tokens, not the same. So the current code is actually returning the number of tokens that are different, which is the opposite of what we need.\n\nSo, to get the count of same tokens, we should use EQ instead of NEQ.

Then it returns the SelectorWidth of same_tok.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think about what this does. The Select function creates a selector where each element (i,j) is True if tokens[i] != tokens[j]. So same_tok is a matrix where the diagonal is False because tokens[i] == tokens[i], and other positions are True where tokens differ.\n\nThen, SelectorWidth(same_tok) counts the number of True values in each row. So for each position i, it counts how many tokens are different from tokens[i]. But that's the opposite of what we want for a histogram. We want to count how many times each token appears, not how many are different.\n\nSo the current code is actually counting, for each token, how many other tokens are different. That's not the histogram. For example, in \"abac\", the first token is 'a'. The same_tok selector would have True for all j where tokens[j] != 'a'. So the count would be the number of non-'a's. But the desired output is the count of 'a's, which is 2 for the first position.\n\nSo the problem is that the current selector is using NEQ, which counts differences. We need to count matches instead.\n\nTo fix this, I should change the predicate from NEQ to EQ. That way, same_tok will be True where tokens[i] == tokens[j], and SelectorWidth will count the number of matches, which is the histogram we want.\n\nLet me test this logic. For the example \"abac\":\n\nIndices: 0 1 2 3\nTokens:  a b a c\n\nThe selector with EQ would be:\n\nRow 0: [True, False, True, False] \u2192 count 2\nRow 1: [False, True, False, False] \u2192 count 1\nRow 2: [True, False, True, False] \u2192 count 2\nRow 3: [False, False, False, True] \u2192 count 1\n\nSo the output would be [2,1,2,1], which matches the example.\n\nTherefore, the fix is to change the predicate in the Select call from Comparison.NEQ to Comparison.EQ.\n\nSo the corrected code should replace same_tok's predicate to EQ.

The Select function creates a matrix where each element (i,j) is True if tokens[i] != tokens[j].

We want the count of tokens that are equal to tokens[i], not the number that are different.\n\nSo the problem is that the predicate is NEQ, which gives us the count of tokens that are not equal. To get the count of equal tokens, we should use EQ instead.\n\nLet me test this logic. Suppose the input is \"abac\", which has tokens [a, b, a, c]. For each position:\n\n- Position 0 (a): tokens equal are positions 0 and 2 \u2192 count 2.\n- Position 1 (b): only position 1 \u2192 count 1.\n- Position 2 (a): same as position 0 \u2192 count 2.\n- Position 3 (c): only position 3 \u2192 count 1.\n\nSo the correct output is [2,1,2,1], which matches the example.\n\nIn the current code, same_tok uses NEQ, so each row i counts the number of tokens not equal to tokens[i]. For \"abac\", that would be:\n\n- Row 0: 2 (b and c) \u2192 but wait, no. Wait, the selector is (tokens != tokens), so for each i, j, it's True if tokens[i] != tokens[j]. So the count for each row is the number of tokens that are different from tokens[i]. \n\nSo for \"abac\", the counts would be:\n\n- Position 0: tokens are a, so count of != a is 2 (b and c) \u2192 but wait, the length is 4, so 4 - count of a is 4-2=2. So same_tok's SelectorWidth would be 2 for position 0, which is correct. Wait, no. Because same_tok is using NEQ, so the count is the number of tokens not equal. So for position 0, it's 2 (b and c), but the actual number of a's is 2. So same_tok's width is 2, which is correct. Wait, that's the same as the desired count. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me think again. The current code is using NEQ, so same_tok is True where tokens[i] != tokens[j]. So for each row i, the count is the number of j where tokens[j] != tokens[i]. So for \"abac\", for i=0, tokens[0] is a. The number of j where tokens[j] != a is 2 (positions 1 and 3). So same_tok's width is 2 for i=0. But the desired count is 2 (number of a's). So in this case, the current code is giving 2, which is correct. But wait, that's the same as the desired count. So why is the example output [2,1,2,1]?\n\nWait, no. Let me calculate again. For \"abac\", the tokens are [a, b, a, c].\n\nFor same_tok using NEQ:\n\nRow 0 (a):\nj=0: a == a \u2192 False\nj=1: b != a \u2192 True\nj=2: a == a \u2192 False\nj=3: c != a \u2192 True\nSo count is 2.\n\nRow 1 (b):\nj=0: a != b \u2192 True\nj=1: b == b \u2192 False\nj=2: a != b \u2192 True\nj=3: c != b \u2192 True\nCount is 3.\n\nRow 2 (a):\nSame as row 0 \u2192 count 2.\n\nRow 3 (c):\nj=0: a != c \u2192 True\nj=1: b != c \u2192 True\nj=2: a != c \u2192 True\nj=3: c == c \u2192 False\nCount is 3.\n\nSo the SelectorWidth would be [2,3,2,3], but the example expects [2,1,2,1]. So clearly, the current code is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see. So the current code is using NEQ, which counts the number of different tokens, but we need to count the number of same tokens. So to get the correct count, we should use EQ instead of NEQ.\n\nSo the fix is to change the predicate from Comparison.NEQ to Comparison.EQ.\n\nLet me adjust the code. The same_tok selector should be created with EQ. So the line should be:\n\nsame_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n\nThen, the SelectorWidth will count the number of True in each row, which is the number of times each token appears.\n\nTesting this with \"abac\":\n\nRow 0 (a):\nj=0: True\nj=1: False\nj=2: True\nj=3: False\nCount is 2.\n\nRow 1 (b):\nj=0: False\nj=1: True\nj=2: False\nj=3: False\nCount is 1.\n\nRow 2 (a):\nSame as row 0 \u2192 count 2.\n\nRow 3 (c):\nj=0: False\nj=1: False\nj=2: False\nj=3: True\nCount is 1.\n\nSo the output is [2,1,2,1], which matches the example.\n\nTherefore, the mistake in the original code was using NEQ instead of EQ.

RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.NEQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.2}
