Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The sel_new selector is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each key's position in the sorted order is its index. So sel_new would select each position correctly. But I'm not sure if the Aggregate is using the correct default. Oh, the default is None, which is correct because if no elements are selected, it returns None. But in this case, each row should have exactly one True, so it's fine. So maybe this function is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the parameters are correctly passed. The modification to keys seems correct to break ties. So this function might be okay.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's see. It calculates the histogram, then negates it so that higher frequencies come first. Then it calls make_sort with hist as the key, but wait, the parameters passed are (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key). But looking at make_sort's signature, the first two parameters are vals and keys. So in make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. That makes sense because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency. But then, after sorting, it multiplies by -1. Wait, the line is return make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1. Oh, that's a problem because you can't multiply a SOp by -1 directly. Instead, you should use rasp.Map to apply the negation.\n\nSo the error is in the last line of make_sort_freq. Instead of multiplying by -1, which isn't a valid operation, we should apply a Map with a lambda that negates each element. So the corrected line should be something like rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, sort_freq_result). But wait, looking at the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the tokens sorted by frequency. The hist for [2,4,2,1] is [2,1,1,1], so negated hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these negated values. But after sorting, the tokens are [2,2,4,1], which is correct. But the current code tries to multiply the SOp by -1, which isn't allowed. So we need to fix that.\n\nSo the make_sort_freq function should return the result of make_sort, then apply a Map to negate each element. Alternatively, perhaps the negation should be applied before sorting, but in this case, the hist is already negated. So the mistake is in the multiplication. So the corrected code would replace the * -1 with a Map.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the hist is created as -1 * make_hist(), but in RASP, you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar directly. Instead, you should use rasp.Map. So the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect. It should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()). That's another issue.\n\nSo to summarize the issues in make_sort_freq:\n\n1. The line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect. It should use rasp.Map to apply the negation.\n2. The return statement tries to multiply the SOp by -1, which is invalid. Instead, it should apply a Map with a lambda that negates each element.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. The make_sort_freq function is trying to sort the tokens based on their frequency. The hist is the count of each token. By negating the hist, when we sort in ascending order, the tokens with higher counts come first. So the code first computes the histogram, then negates it, then sorts based on these negated values. But the way it's done is incorrect because you can't multiply SOp by a scalar.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq should:\n\n- Compute the histogram using make_hist().\n- Negate each element of the histogram using rasp.Map.\n- Use this negated histogram as the key in make_sort.\n- The result of make_sort is the sorted tokens, but since the keys were negated, the tokens are ordered from highest frequency to lowest. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, and the others once. So after sorting, the tokens are in the order of their frequency.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the same as the input but with the two 2's first. So the sorting is correct.\n\nBut the problem is in the way the negation is applied. So the corrected code for make_sort_freq should be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist())\nsort_result = make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\nreturn sort_result\n\nWait, no. Because make_sort returns the sorted vals based on the keys. So in this case, the keys are the negated histogram. So the tokens will be sorted in ascending order of their negated histogram, which is the same as descending order of their original histogram. So the most frequent tokens come first.\n\nBut in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So the code should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but the original code had a * -1 at the end. So perhaps the intention was to negate the sorted result, but that's incorrect because the sorted result is the token values, not the histogram. So negating the tokens doesn't make sense. Therefore, the original code's * -1 is a mistake and should be removed.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original code does:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nBut both of these are incorrect because you can't multiply SOp by a scalar. So the correct approach is to use rasp.Map for both the histogram negation and any other necessary transformations.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq should:\n\n1. Compute the histogram.\n2. Negate each element of the histogram using Map.\n3. Use this negated histogram as the key in make_sort.\n4. Return the sorted tokens.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the tokens sorted by frequency. So the code should work as intended.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique, allowing make_sort_unique to work correctly even if there are ties.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main issues are in make_sort_freq where scalar multiplication is used instead of Map. So the corrected code should replace those parts.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2601, "total_tokens": 7224}}, {"id": "gen-1738410408-jKt6N6Bcy4P0yX4lgSh7", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410408, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we need to address two main issues in the `make_sort_freq` function. \n\n1. **Keyword Arguments**: The `make_sort` function call must use keyword arguments for `max_seq_len` and `min_key` to ensure correct parameter assignment.\n\n2. **Invalid Multiplication**: The return statement incorrectly attempts to multiply the result by `-1`, which isn't valid in RASP.

Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each position, it counts how many keys are smaller. So when we select where target_pos equals indices, for each index i, we select the key at position i. Then aggregating vals with this selector should pick the correct value. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this correctly sorts the values. Maybe it's correct, but perhaps there's an issue with how the selector is used in Aggregate.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature seems correct.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp. Inside, it calls make_sort with rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len and min_key=1. But looking at make_sort's parameters, it expects (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But in the current code, it's written as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1), which is incorrect because the positional arguments after * must be keyword arguments. So this is a syntax error. That's a problem.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq(), the return statement is written as return make_sort(...) * -1. But in RASP, operations are composed, and multiplying by -1 isn't directly possible unless it's a Map. So instead of multiplying, we should apply a Map to negate the values.\n\nSo the issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is incorrect because it's passing max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments instead of keyword arguments.\n\n2. The return statement tries to multiply by -1, which isn't valid. Instead, we should use rasp.Map to negate the values.\n\nLet me correct these.\n\nFor the first issue, the make_sort call should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. So it should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).\n\nFor the second issue, instead of * -1, we should apply a Map with a lambda that multiplies by -1. So the return becomes rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_sort(...)).\n\nWait, but looking back, the hist is already negated. So when we sort, the keys are -hist, which sorts in ascending order of frequency. Then, when we return, do we need to negate again? Let me think. The example shows that after sorting, the tokens are ordered by frequency. So perhaps the initial negation is correct, and the final result doesn't need another negation. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), hist is the count of each token. By negating it, the keys become -count. So when sorted in ascending order (since make_sort uses < relation), the tokens with higher counts come first because their negative counts are smaller. So the sorting is correct. But the return statement is trying to negate the sorted values, which would reverse the order. That might be incorrect.\n\nWait, the example given is [2,4,2,1] which has counts [2,1,2,1]. So hist is [2,1,2,1], then negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the keys, which are -2, -1, etc. So the sorted order would be the tokens with the smallest keys (most negative) first. So tokens with count 2 come before count 1. So the sorted output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. But then, the return statement multiplies by -1, which would change the token values, not the order. Oh wait, no, the return is the sorted tokens, not the keys. So multiplying by -1 would change the token values, which is not intended. So that's a mistake.\n\nSo the return statement should not multiply by -1. Instead, it should just return the sorted tokens. So the line should be:\n\nreturn make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, the current code has hist = -1 * make_hist(), which is correct because it's using the negative of the histogram as the key for sorting. So the sorting is based on the negative histogram, which sorts tokens with higher frequency first. Then, the return value is the sorted tokens, so no further negation is needed. So the mistake is that the return statement is incorrectly trying to multiply by -1, which would alter the token values, not the sorting key.\n\nSo the correct approach is to remove the * -1 part and just return the sorted tokens.\n\nPutting it all together, the corrections needed are:\n\n1. Fix the make_sort call in make_sort_freq() to use keyword arguments.\n\n2. Remove the * -1 and instead use a Map if needed, but in this case, it's not needed because the sorting is correct without it.\n\nWait, no. The current code in make_sort_freq() is:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nBut this is incorrect because the * operator isn't applicable. So we need to replace it with a Map that negates each element. But wait, do we need to negate the sorted tokens? No, because the hist was negated to sort, but the tokens themselves should remain as they are. So the * -1 is a mistake and should be removed.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but in the original code, the return is (make_sort(...)) * -1. So perhaps the intention was to negate the sorted values, but that's incorrect because the tokens are being sorted based on their frequency, and their values should remain the same.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position exactly once. Aggregating vals with this selector should pick the correct value. But wait, in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is sorted. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So that's correct. The modification to keys should ensure uniqueness, allowing make_sort_unique to work. So this seems okay.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It computes hist as -1 * make_hist(). Then passes hist to make_sort as the keys, along with tokens as vals. Then multiplies the result by -1. Wait, but make_sort returns the sorted vals based on the keys. So hist is the frequency, but negated. So when sorting, lower frequencies come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] has hist [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated frequencies. But the example expects [2,2,4,1], which is the original order for tokens with the same frequency. Hmm, maybe the issue is that when frequencies are the same, the sort isn't stable, so the order isn't preserved.\n\nWait, in make_sort_unique(), when keys are unique, it sorts correctly, but when keys are the same, it might not maintain the original order. So in make_sort_freq(), when multiple tokens have the same frequency, their order in the output isn't preserved. But the example expects that tokens with the same frequency appear in the same order as the input.\n\nSo the problem is that make_sort() doesn't handle tie cases correctly. It uses make_sort_unique(), which assumes all keys are unique. But in make_sort_freq(), the keys are the negated frequencies, which can have duplicates when tokens have the same frequency. So when multiple tokens have the same frequency, their order isn't maintained.\n\nTo fix this, the sorting needs to be stable, preserving the original order for tokens with the same key. But how can this be achieved in RASP?\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it uses make_sort_unique(), which doesn't handle ties. So perhaps the approach in make_sort() needs to be adjusted to include the original indices as a secondary key when sorting.\n\nAlternatively, in make_sort_freq(), after computing the frequencies, we can create a composite key that includes both the frequency and the original index. That way, when frequencies are the same, the tokens are sorted by their original positions, thus maintaining the order.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq(), instead of just using hist as the key, we can create a new key that is a tuple of (hist, index). But since RASP works with sequences, we need to combine these into a single numerical key.\n\nLet me think about how to do that. For each token, the key would be hist + (index * epsilon), where epsilon is a small value to ensure uniqueness without affecting the sorting order significantly. But since we can't use loops or conditionals, we need to compute this using RASP operations.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So perhaps in make_sort_freq(), we can adjust the keys to include both the frequency and the index.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq(), after computing hist, we can create a new key by adding the index scaled appropriately. For example:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + i * min_key / max_seq_len, hist, rasp.indices)\n\nBut wait, hist is the negated frequency. So when we add the index, it ensures that for tokens with the same frequency, the one with the smaller index comes first, thus preserving the original order.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq(), the code should be:\n\nhist = make_hist()\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + i * min_key / max_seq_len, neg_hist, rasp.indices)\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=min_key)\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq() is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nSo the problem is that hist is just the negated frequency, without considering the index. So when multiple tokens have the same frequency, their order isn't preserved.\n\nSo the fix is to modify the keys in make_sort_freq() to include both the negated frequency and the index, ensuring that when frequencies are the same, the original order is maintained.\n\nSo, I'll adjust make_sort_freq() to compute a composite key. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the histogram (frequency) of each token.\n2. Negate the histogram so that lower frequencies come first.\n3. Add the index scaled by a small factor to ensure uniqueness and maintain order.\n4. Use this composite key in make_sort().\n\nBut wait, in make_sort(), the keys are already being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So perhaps in make_sort_freq(), we can set min_key to a small value and adjust the keys accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq(), the keys are just the negated histogram, leading to possible ties. So the solution is to adjust the keys to include the index as a secondary key.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq(), after computing hist, we create a new key that combines hist and the index. For example:\n\nhist = make_hist()\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\nindices = rasp.indices\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + i * 0.1, neg_hist, indices)\n\nThen pass keys to make_sort.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort(), the function already adds min_key * i / max_seq_len to the keys. So perhaps in make_sort_freq(), we can set min_key to a small value, like 0.1, so that the index is used as a tiebreaker.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_sort() function's approach of adding min_key * i / max_seq_len is sufficient, but in make_sort_freq(), the keys are not being adjusted correctly.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the current code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nSo the keys are the negated histogram. Then, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key, it's key + (1 * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique, even if the original keys are the same.\n\nSo when two tokens have the same frequency, their keys after modification will be different because their indices are different. Thus, the sorting will be based on the original frequency, and for ties, the index will determine the order, thus preserving the original order.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort() is called with min_key=1. So the added term is 1 * i / max_seq_len. For example, if max_seq_len is 5, then the added term for i=0 is 0, i=1 is 0.2, etc. So for tokens with the same frequency, the one with the smaller index will have a smaller key, thus appearing earlier in the sorted list.\n\nSo in the example where tokens are [2,4,2,1], the frequencies are [2,1,2,1]. So neg_hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding i * 1 / 5. So the keys become:\n\nFor i=0: -2 + 0 = -2\n\ni=1: -1 + 0.2 = -0.8\n\ni=2: -2 + 0.4 = -1.6\n\ni=3: -1 + 0.6 = -0.4\n\nSo the keys are [-2, -0.8, -1.6, -0.4]. When sorted in ascending order, the order of indices would be 0, 2, 1, 3. So the sorted tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which is the expected output.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the make_sort() function is called with min_key=1, which is correct. So why isn't it working as expected?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq(), the return statement is multiplying by -1, which might be incorrect. Let me see:\n\nThe make_sort() function returns the sorted tokens based on the keys. The keys are the negated frequencies plus the index term. So the tokens are sorted in ascending order of keys, which correspond to ascending order of negated frequencies (i.e., lower frequencies first). But in the example, the tokens with higher frequency (2) should come first. So perhaps the multiplication by -1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The hist is the frequency, so neg_hist is -hist. So when we sort based on neg_hist, lower values (more negative) come first, which correspond to higher frequencies. So the tokens are sorted from highest to lowest frequency. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, and 1 once. So the sorted order is based on frequency descending.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the order of the tokens sorted by frequency. So the code seems correct. But perhaps the issue is that the multiplication by -1 is applied to the output of make_sort(), which is the sorted tokens. That would invert the values, which is not intended.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nreturn make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nSo the output of make_sort() is the sorted tokens, and then each token is multiplied by -1. That's incorrect because it's changing the token values, not the order. So in the example, the tokens [2,4,2,1] would become [-2,-4,-2,-1], which is not the intended result.\n\nAh, that's the bug! The code is multiplying the sorted tokens by -1, which changes their values instead of just sorting them. So the function should return the sorted tokens without multiplying by -1.\n\nSo the correct code should be:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWithout the * -1 at the end.\n\nSo that's the mistake. The multiplication by -1 is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nSo the summary of the issues:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the return statement incorrectly multiplies the result by -1, altering the token values instead of just sorting them.\n\nThe fix is to remove the multiplication by -1.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but wait: the hist is already negated, so when passed to make_sort(), which sorts in ascending order, the tokens will be ordered from most frequent to least frequent. So the sorted order is correct without needing to negate again.\n\nSo the final step is to correct the return statement by removing the * -1.\n\nSo the final code for make_sort_freq() is as above.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function expects max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. But in the current code, the function is defined with * max_seq_len and min_key, which is correct.\n\nWait, no, in the function definition, the parameters after * are keyword-only. So when calling make_sort(), the arguments after the first two must be passed as keyword arguments. But in the example, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which passes max_seq_len as 5 and min_key as 1 positionally. That's incorrect because after the * in the function definition, all parameters must be passed as keyword arguments.\n\nSo the function call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1). But in the current code, the example usage is incorrect. However, in the provided code, the function is called correctly in make_sort_freq() as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1), which is correct.\n\nWait, no, in the provided code, the function is called as:\n\nmake_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nWhich is correct because max_seq_len and min_key are passed as keyword arguments.\n\nSo the function definition is correct, and the example usage in the code is correct. So that's not an issue.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if min_key is not small enough? For example, if the keys have a large range, adding min_key * i / max_seq_len might not ensure uniqueness. But in the context of RASP, this is the approach taken, so it's acceptable.\n\nSo the main issue is the incorrect multiplication by -1 in make_sort_freq(). Removing that should fix the problem.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 4059, "total_tokens": 8682}}, {"id": "gen-1738410715-rP7RloJ8CA3YqS7W0P6L", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410715, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified issues in the `make_sort_freq` function where scalar multiplication was incorrectly applied to SOps.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by checking if target_pos equals indices. Then it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position in the sorted array is based on how many are smaller. So when we select using target_pos and indices, it should pick the correct vals. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the Aggregate is correctly picking the right value. Maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature is correct. But looking at the code, the keys are being reassigned. Oh wait, the function parameter is 'keys' and then it's being overwritten. That's a problem because it shadows the original parameter. So instead of using the original keys, it's creating a new variable. That's incorrect. It should use a different variable name, like 'unique_keys' or something else. Otherwise, when it calls make_sort_unique(vals, keys), it's using the modified keys, which is correct. Wait, no, because after reassignment, 'keys' is the new unique keys. So maybe that's intentional. But it's bad practice to shadow the parameter. Maybe that's not the issue.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with tokens and hist. Wait, hist is the negative of the histogram. So when sorting, it's sorting by the negative frequency, which would order from highest to lowest frequency. But then it multiplies the result by -1. Wait, no, the line is 'return make_sort(...) * -1'. But make_sort returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Oh, that's a problem. Instead, it should apply a Map to multiply each element by -1. So the correct way is to use rasp.Map(lambda x: x * -1, ...). So that's a bug.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_freq(). The line 'return make_sort(...) * -1' is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. Instead, you should use rasp.Map to apply the multiplication.\n\nSo to fix it, I'll change that line to use Map. Also, in make_sort(), shadowing 'keys' is not ideal, but it's functionally correct. However, to avoid confusion, maybe rename the variable.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is created as -1 * make_hist(), but in RASP, you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar directly. So that's another issue. Instead, you should use rasp.Map to apply the negation.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line 'hist = -1 * make_hist()' is incorrect. It should be something like rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).\n\nPutting it all together, the errors are:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed incorrectly by multiplying by -1. Should use Map.\n2. The return statement in make_sort_freq() tries to multiply the SOp by -1, which is invalid. Should use Map instead.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() would first compute hist correctly using Map, then sort, then apply Map again to negate the result.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n- In make_sort_freq():\n  - Change hist = -1 * make_hist() to hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist())\n  - Change the return statement to apply Map for negation.\n\nWait, but looking at the example, when hist is negated, the sorting is based on negative frequencies. So when we sort, higher frequencies come first. Then, when we return, we need to negate again to get the original order. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the example in make_sort_freq() is [2,4,2,1] which has frequencies 2,1,2,1. So hist would be [2,1,2,1], then negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated frequencies. So the sorted indices would be based on the smallest (most negative) first. So the sorted order would be 1, 3, 0, 2, resulting in [1,2,4,2] but wait, the example shows [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the logic wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the way the negation is applied is wrong because of how the multiplication is done.\n\nSo the main point is that in RASP, you can't just multiply an SOp by a scalar; you have to use Map.\n\nSo the corrected code would replace the multiplication with Map.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the hist should be created using Map, and the return statement should also use Map.\n\nSo the revised function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, sorted_tokens)\n\nWait, no, because after sorting, we need to negate the sorted tokens? Or perhaps not. Wait, the original code did 'return make_sort(...) * -1', which suggests that the sorting was in the wrong order, so negating the result would fix it. But since we can't multiply, we have to apply a Map.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nThe make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So when we pass negated histogram as keys, the tokens will be sorted from lowest to highest negated frequency, which is equivalent to highest to lowest actual frequency. So the sorted tokens will be in the order of highest frequency first. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the two 2's come first because they have higher frequency.\n\nWait, in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1], the frequencies are 2 for 2, 1 for 4, 2 for 2 again, and 1 for 1. So the sorted order based on frequency (descending) would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct. But the way the negation is applied is wrong because it's using multiplication instead of Map.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the correct code should be:\n\nhist = make_hist()\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\nsorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\nreturn sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but the original code had 'return make_sort(...) * -1', which suggests that the sorting was in the wrong order. But if we pass the negated hist as keys, the sorting should already be correct. So perhaps the original code was trying to negate the sorted values, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the mistake is that the return statement was incorrectly trying to negate the sorted tokens, which is wrong. Instead, the sorted tokens are already in the correct order based on the negated hist.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: when you sort by keys in ascending order, using negated frequencies will sort from most negative (highest frequency) to least negative (lowest frequency). So the tokens will be ordered from highest to lowest frequency, which is what we want. So the return value should just be the sorted tokens, without negation.\n\nSo the original code's return statement was wrong because it tried to negate the sorted tokens, which would reverse their order. So the correct approach is to remove that multiplication.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the return is:\n\nreturn make_sort(...) * -1\n\nWhich is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar. So the correct code should not do that. Instead, it should just return the sorted tokens.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the hist is negated, so when passed to make_sort, the sorting is based on the negated frequencies. So the tokens are sorted in the correct order without needing to negate again.\n\nSo the mistake is that the original code tried to negate the result, which is incorrect. So the correct code should be:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the hist is negated and then passed as keys. So the make_sort function sorts the tokens based on the negated hist in ascending order, which is correct. So the return value is the correctly sorted tokens, and there's no need to negate again.\n\nSo the original code's mistake was twofold:\n\n1. It computed hist as -1 * make_hist(), which is invalid. It should use Map.\n2. It tried to negate the result of make_sort, which is also invalid and incorrect.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() should:\n\n- Compute the histogram.\n- Negate it using Map.\n- Sort the tokens based on the negated histogram.\n- Return the sorted tokens without further negation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected function is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but in the original code, the return was multiplied by -1. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and the sorting was done in the wrong order. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code intended to sort in ascending order of frequency, so it negated the histogram, sorted, and then negated the result. But that doesn't make sense because the tokens are being sorted, not their frequencies.\n\nNo, I think the original code had two errors: using multiplication instead of Map for negation, and trying to negate the sorted tokens, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the final conclusion is that in make_sort_freq(), the hist should be negated using Map, and the return statement should just return the sorted tokens without any further operations.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nWait, but in the original code, the return was (make_sort(...)) * -1, which is wrong. So the correct code removes that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the function signature is correct. The parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So when calling make_sort in make_sort_freq(), it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and neg_hist as keys, which is correct.\n\nSo the main fixes are in make_sort_freq(), correcting the negation of hist and removing the incorrect multiplication in the return statement.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3374, "total_tokens": 7997}}, {"id": "gen-1738410818-6M6cQqEL9OhrRmc665nn", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410818, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main issues were incorrect function signatures and improper transformation of the sorted output.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position exactly once. That should correctly sort the values. Hmm, maybe this is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the parameters are correctly passed. But in the function, when it calls make_sort_unique, it's passing 'keys' which is the modified one. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort function is defined with a different signature. Oh, looking back, the user provided code has make_sort with parameters (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the function, it's using keys as the modified keys. That should be fine.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as the key. But wait, in the example, the tokens are [2,4,2,1], the hist would be [2,1,2,1]. Negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted, the order would be based on these negated hist values. But the example expects [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency. However, the current code returns make_sort(...)*-1. Wait, no, the code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist()\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...).named(...) * -1\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because make_sort returns an SOp, and then multiplying by -1 would apply a Map. But the example expects the tokens sorted by frequency, not the negated values. So perhaps the issue is that the code is negating the histogram, sorting based on that, and then negating the result, which might not be correct.\n\nWait, let me think. The make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if we want to sort tokens by frequency in descending order, we should use the negative histogram as the key. Then, the sorted tokens would be arranged from highest frequency to lowest. But the current code is taking the histogram, negating it, and using that as the key for sorting. So when sorted in ascending order, it's equivalent to sorting the original histogram in descending order. That makes sense.\n\nBut then, after sorting, the code multiplies by -1. Wait, no, the code is:\n\nreturn make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWait, that's not right. Because make_sort returns the sorted tokens, not the keys. So multiplying by -1 would negate each token's value, which is incorrect. The example expects the tokens sorted by frequency, not their values negated.\n\nSo the mistake is that the code is applying a multiplication by -1 to the sorted tokens, which changes their values. Instead, it should just return the sorted tokens without modification.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line should be:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWithout the * -1 at the end.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), the parameters are (max_seq_len: int). But in the function call to make_sort, it's passing max_seq_len=max_seq_len and min_key=1. But looking at make_sort's definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort_freq function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). Wait, no, looking back, the example usage in the code is:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) >> [2,2,4,1]\n\nWait, no, the example in the code is:\n\nExample usage:\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2,4,2,1])\n>> [2,2,4,1]\n\nWait, but the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. So it only takes max_seq_len as a parameter. But in the example, it's being called with three arguments. That's a problem. The function signature is incorrect.\n\nSo the function should take max_seq_len as an argument, but in the example, it's being called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That suggests that the function should perhaps take vals and keys, but in the current code, it's not. So that's another issue.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nBut this function doesn't take vals and keys as parameters. So when the example tries to call it with make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), it's incorrect because the function expects only max_seq_len.\n\nSo the function signature is wrong. It should probably take vals and keys, but in the current code, it's using rasp.tokens directly. That's a problem because it's not generalizable. The function should instead take vals and keys as parameters, similar to make_sort.\n\nSo to fix this, the make_sort_freq function should be redefined to take vals and keys, and then compute the histogram based on those keys. But wait, the histogram is based on the tokens, so perhaps the function is intended to sort the tokens based on their frequency. So maybe the function should take the tokens as the keys. But the current code is hardcoded to use rasp.tokens, which isn't flexible.\n\nSo to make it correct, the function should take keys as a parameter. So the corrected function should have parameters (keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int). Then, compute the histogram of keys, negate it, and sort the keys based on that.\n\nWait, but in the example, the function is called without passing keys, which suggests that perhaps the function is intended to work on the tokens. So perhaps the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut then, the function is tied to using rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. That might be the intended behavior, but the example usage suggests that it's being called with tokens as arguments, which isn't possible with the current signature.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should take vals and keys, but in the example, it's called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). So the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in this case, the hist is based on the keys, which are the same as the tokens. So perhaps the function should compute the histogram of the keys, then sort the vals based on that.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express the intended functionality.\n\nThe make_sort_freq function is supposed to sort the tokens based on their frequency in the input. So the keys for sorting are the frequencies of each token. So for each token, we count how many times it appears (hist), then sort the tokens in the order of decreasing frequency.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the histogram (frequency) of each token in the input.\n2. Use this histogram as the key to sort the tokens.\n3. Since make_sort sorts in ascending order, we negate the histogram so that higher frequencies come first.\n4. Ensure that the keys are unique by adding a small value based on position.\n5. Sort the tokens based on these modified keys.\n\nBut in the current code, the function is hardcoded to use rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. So perhaps the function should instead take the tokens as the keys and the values to sort.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    # Negate hist to sort in descending order\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    # Use neg_hist as keys, and tokens as vals\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_tokens.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the hist is negated and used as keys. Then, the sorted tokens are returned, but then multiplied by -1, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the main issues are:\n\n1. The make_sort_freq function has an incorrect signature. It should take the keys (tokens) and possibly the values, but in the current code, it's not.\n\n2. The function returns the sorted tokens multiplied by -1, which is wrong because it changes the token values instead of just sorting them.\n\nSo to fix this, the function should:\n\n- Take the necessary parameters (probably keys, which are the tokens).\n- Compute the histogram of the keys.\n- Negate the histogram to sort in descending order.\n- Use make_sort to sort the keys based on the negated histogram, ensuring uniqueness.\n- Return the sorted keys without modifying their values.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_sort_freq function would:\n\n- Compute the histogram of the tokens.\n- Negate the histogram to get keys for sorting in descending order.\n- Sort the tokens based on these keys, ensuring each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position.\n- Return the sorted tokens.\n\nAdditionally, the function's parameters need to be adjusted to accept the necessary inputs, but according to the example, it's called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that it should take both vals and keys. But in the current code, it's not. So perhaps the function should be redefined to take vals and keys, with default values if necessary.\n\nWait, but in the example, the function is called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which implies that the function expects three arguments. But the current function only takes max_seq_len. So the function signature is incorrect.\n\nSo to fix this, the function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    # Modify keys to ensure uniqueness\n    modified_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (1.0 / max_seq_len) * i,\n        neg_hist,\n        rasp.indices\n    )\n    sorted_vals = make_sort_unique(vals, modified_keys)\n    return sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but this approach might not be necessary because make_sort already handles ensuring unique keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So perhaps the function can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_sort_freq function should compute the histogram, negate it, and then use make_sort with the negated histogram as keys, ensuring they are unique.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected code would involve:\n\n- Fixing the function signature of make_sort_freq to accept the necessary parameters.\n- Correctly computing the histogram and using it as the key for sorting.\n- Ensuring that the keys are made unique without altering the sorting order beyond what's necessary.\n- Returning the sorted values without applying any incorrect operations like multiplication.\n\nAnother thing to check is the use of rasp.SequenceMap in make_sort. It's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to the keys. So in make_sort_freq, when we pass the negated histogram as keys, the make_sort function will handle ensuring they are unique.\n\nSo, the steps to fix make_sort_freq are:\n\n1. Change the function signature to accept vals and keys, with max_seq_len as a required parameter.\n\nWait, but in the example, the function is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). So the function should have parameters (vals, keys, max_seq_len). But in the current code, it's only taking max_seq_len.\n\nSo the corrected function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    return make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in this case, the keys are the negated histogram. However, the make_sort function expects the keys to be numerical. Since hist is a count, negating it makes sense for sorting in descending order.\n\nBut in the original code, the make_sort function is called with hist as the keys, which is the frequency. So this approach should work.\n\nAnother issue is that in the original code, the make_sort_freq function returns the result multiplied by -1, which is incorrect. So removing that part is essential.\n\nSo, to summarize the fixes:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq, correct the function signature to accept vals and keys.\n2. Compute the histogram of the keys.\n3. Negate the histogram to sort in descending order.\n4. Use make_sort with the negated histogram as keys, ensuring uniqueness.\n5. Return the sorted vals without any further transformation.\n\nAdditionally, in the original code, the make_sort function's call in make_sort_freq is using rasp.tokens as both vals and keys, which might not be correct. It should instead use the passed vals and keys.\n\nWait, no. In the make_sort_freq function, the keys are the frequencies of the tokens, so the function should compute the histogram based on the tokens (keys) and then sort the tokens (vals) based on their frequency.\n\nSo, the function should:\n\n- Take vals (the tokens to sort) and keys (the tokens whose frequency is calculated).\n- Compute the histogram of the keys.\n- Negate the histogram to sort in descending order.\n- Use make_sort to sort the vals based on the negated histogram.\n\nBut wait, the histogram is computed based on the keys, which are the same as the tokens. So the function can be written as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")  # This is based on keys (tokens)\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    sorted_vals = make_sort(vals, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, in this case, the keys for make_sort are the negated histogram, which is based on the frequency of each token. So when sorting, each token's position is determined by its frequency.\n\nBut in the example, when the input is [2,4,2,1], the histogram is [2,1,2,1]. Negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted in ascending order, the order would be based on these negated values. So the sorted indices would be [1,3,0,2], which correspond to the original tokens [4,1,2,2]. But the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that suggests that the sorting is not working as intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how make_sort works. The make_sort function sorts the vals based on the keys in ascending order. So if the keys are [-2,-1,-2,-1], the sorted order would arrange the elements from the smallest key to the largest. So the order of keys would be -2, -2, -1, -1. So the corresponding vals (tokens) would be 2,2,4,1. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the function should work correctly if the keys are the negated histogram.\n\nBut in the current code, the make_sort_freq function is not taking vals and keys as parameters, which is causing issues. So the function needs to be redefined to accept these parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, the corrected code would involve:\n\n- Fixing the function signatures where necessary.\n- Ensuring that the histogram is correctly computed and used.\n- Removing the incorrect multiplication by -1.\n- Correctly using make_sort with the appropriate parameters.\n\nAnother thing to check is the use of rasp.SequenceMap in make_sort. It's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to the keys to ensure uniqueness. This should handle cases where multiple elements have the same key value, ensuring a total order.\n\nSo, the final steps are:\n\n1.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each index exactly once, and aggregate should pick the correct value. Hmm, maybe this is correct, but I'm not sure. Let me think about how Aggregate works. It averages the selected values, but since each row of sel_new has only one True, it should pick that single value. So this should work for unique keys. So maybe no issue here.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, each key becomes unique. So when sorted, it should order correctly. But looking at the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, the user did make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function expects four arguments, but in the code, the function is defined as make_sort(vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So when calling make_sort, the user passes four positional arguments, but the function expects two positional and two keyword. That would cause a TypeError because the function expects 2 positional arguments but got 4. Oh, that's a problem. So the function signature is incorrect. It should accept max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments, but the way it's written, they are required positional. So I need to adjust the function signature to have default values or make them keyword-only. Alternatively, perhaps the function should be called with keyword arguments, but the example shows it's called positionally. So to fix this, I should change the function signature to have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments with default values. But looking at the code, the current signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp: ... So the * makes them keyword-only. But in the example, the user calls make_sort with positional arguments, which would cause an error. So to fix this, perhaps the function should accept the parameters as keyword arguments. Alternatively, the example usage is incorrect. Wait, no, the example shows make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which passes four positional arguments, but the function expects only two positional and two keyword. So that's a problem. So I need to adjust the function signature to accept all four as positional or make the last two have default values. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have max_seq_len and min_key as optional with defaults. But in the code, they are required. So that's a bug. So I should modify the function to have default values for max_seq_len and min_key, or adjust how it's called.\n\nWait, looking back, the function is called in make_sort_freq as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct because it's passing keyword arguments. But in the example usage, the user is calling it with positional arguments, which would fail. So perhaps the function should have default values for max_seq_len and min_key. Alternatively, the example is incorrect. But the function's current signature requires max_seq_len and min_key to be passed as keyword arguments. So the example is wrong. But the user's code is as given, so perhaps the function should be adjusted to accept positional arguments. Alternatively, the function should have default values. Let me think: in the function definition, the parameters after * are keyword-only, so the function can't be called with positional arguments for them. So the example usage is incorrect. But the user's code is as given, so perhaps the function should be modified to have default values. Alternatively, perhaps the function should not have the * and allow positional arguments. Hmm, but that's a design choice. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have max_seq_len and min_key as optional with default values. For example, setting max_seq_len to a default like None, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the function should be called with keyword arguments in the example. But since the user provided the code as is, I need to fix the function so that it can be called correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the function signature is correct, but the example usage is wrong. So in the example, the user should call make_sort with keyword arguments. But the code as given in the example is incorrect. So perhaps the function is correct, but the example is wrong. But the task is to repair the program, so perhaps the function's parameters are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the function should accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments. So to fix this, I can remove the * and make them positional. So the function signature would be def make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). But that would require four positional arguments. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have default values. For example, max_seq_len could default to 0, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only with default values. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the function is correct, and the example is wrong, but the user's code is as given, so perhaps the function should be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is intended to be called with four arguments, so the signature should be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key):\n\nBut in the code, it's written with * which makes the last two keyword-only. So perhaps the function should be modified to remove the * and accept four positional arguments. So that's one issue.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), the code is hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). Wait, can you multiply a SOp by -1? Because SOp is a sequence operation, and in RASP, the operations are built using functions. So perhaps you can't just multiply by -1. Instead, you should use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that multiplies by -1. So the line should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\"). So that's another bug.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. Instead, you need to use Map. So that's a problem.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if max_seq_len is zero, this would cause division by zero. So perhaps we should ensure that max_seq_len is not zero. But the function's parameters don't have default values, so the caller must provide them. So perhaps that's okay.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. The function make_sort() has a incorrect signature, causing errors when called with positional arguments.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect and should use rasp.Map.\n3. The example usage in make_sort() is incorrect because it's passing positional arguments instead of keyword arguments.\n\nSo to fix these:\n\nFor issue 1: Change the function signature of make_sort to accept max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments with default values, or adjust the way it's called. Alternatively, remove the * and make them positional. But looking at the code, in make_sort_freq, it's called with keyword arguments, which is correct. So perhaps the function should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only with default values. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have default values. For example:\n\ndef make_sort(vals, keys, *, max_seq_len: int = 0, min_key: float = 0.0):\n\nBut I'm not sure if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have the * removed, allowing positional arguments. But that's a design decision.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should be called with keyword arguments in the example. But since the example is part of the code, perhaps the function should be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is intended to have max_seq_len and min_key as optional, so I'll give them default values. For example, max_seq_len=0 and min_key=0.0, but that might not be suitable. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only without defaults, but that would require the caller to provide them, which is the case in make_sort_freq.\n\nBut the example usage in the code is:\n\nsort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n\nWhich is passing four positional arguments, which doesn't match the function's signature. So the function's signature is incorrect. So to fix this, I need to adjust the function signature to accept four positional arguments. So I'll remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key positional.\n\nSo the corrected function signature would be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut then, in make_sort_freq, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1), which is correct because it's passing the last two as keyword arguments. So that's okay.\n\nWait, no. If the function signature is modified to have four positional parameters, then in make_sort_freq, when called with keyword arguments, it's still correct. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo that's the first fix: adjust make_sort's signature.\n\nSecond fix: in make_sort_freq, replace hist = -1 * make_hist() with a Map that applies lambda x: -x.\n\nThird, check if there are other issues. For example, in make_sort, when creating the new keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if max_seq_len is zero, this would cause a division by zero error. So perhaps we should add a check or handle that case. But since max_seq_len is provided by the user, perhaps it's their responsibility to ensure it's non-zero.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_unique, the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). But according to the rules, Aggregate should always have None as the default. In the current code, the default is not specified, so it's None by default. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking at the Aggregate function in the source code, the default is Optional[VT] = None. So in the code, when Aggregate is called without a default, it's set to None. So that's correct.\n\nSo the main issues are the function signature and the multiplication in make_sort_freq.\n\nSo now, I'll outline the steps to fix the code:\n\n1. In make_sort(), change the function signature to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments, removing the *.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), replace the line hist = -1 * make_hist() with a rasp.Map that applies a lambda to multiply by -1.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nFor make_sort:\n\nChange from:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nTo:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nFor make_sort_freq:\n\nChange:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nTo:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nWait, but make_hist() returns a SOp, so applying Map with lambda x: -x is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected functions are:\n\nmake_hist remains the same.\n\nmake_sort_unique remains the same.\n\nmake_sort's function signature is fixed.\n\nmake_sort_freq is fixed.\n\nI think that's the main issues. Let me check if there are any other problems.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq, the return statement is:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWait, again, multiplying by -1 is incorrect. So that line should also be fixed. Instead of multiplying, use a Map.\n\nSo the return statement should be:\n\nsorted_vals = make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\nreturn rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, sorted_vals).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nAlternatively, since the hist was already negated, perhaps the sorting is correct, but the return statement's multiplication is wrong. So yes, that line is also a problem.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, after getting the sorted values, we can't just multiply by -1. Instead, we need to apply a Map.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n    sorted_vals = make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, sorted_vals).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but why? Because hist is negated, and then sorted based on hist. So the sorted order would be based on the negated frequencies. Then, applying -x again would revert the order. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: the hist is the frequency count. By negating it, the sorting is done in ascending order of the negated frequencies, which is equivalent to descending order of the original frequencies. So after sorting, the tokens are ordered from highest frequency to lowest. But then, applying -x again on the sorted values would negate the token values, which is not intended. So perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The make_sort function sorts the vals based on the keys. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated hist (frequencies). So the tokens are sorted in ascending order of their negated frequencies, which is the same as descending order of their actual frequencies. So the sorted tokens are from highest frequency to lowest. Then, the return statement is trying to negate the sorted values again, which would change the token values, not their order. That's not correct. So perhaps the multiplication by -1 in the return statement is a mistake. Instead, the return should just return the sorted_vals without negation.\n\nWait, looking back at the original code:\n\nreturn make_sort(...) * -1\n\nWhich is incorrect because you can't multiply a SOp by a scalar. So the original code is wrong. So the correct approach is to remove that multiplication and just return the sorted_vals. Or perhaps the intention was to negate the sorted values, but that's not needed because the sorting is based on the keys, not the values.\n\nWait, the make_sort function returns the vals sorted according to the keys. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated frequencies, so the tokens are sorted in the order of their frequency. The return statement then tries to negate the sorted token values, which is incorrect because it changes the token values, not their order. So that's a bug. So the correct approach is to not negate the sorted values. So the return statement should be:\n\nreturn sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, after getting the sorted_vals, we just return them without negation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_sort_freq function is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\"\"\"\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    sorted_vals = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the hist is negated and used as keys. So the make_sort function sorts the tokens based on the negated hist. So the tokens are ordered from highest frequency to lowest. So the return value is the sorted tokens, which is correct. So the original code's mistake was trying to negate the sorted values again, which is wrong. So the corrected code should not do that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Fix make_sort's function signature to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, replace the multiplication with a Map to negate the hist, and then sort based on that. Then return the sorted values without negation.\n\nWait, no. The original code in make_sort_freq was:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWhich is incorrect. So the correct approach is to create a negated hist using Map, then pass that as keys to make_sort, and return the sorted vals without negation.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    sorted_vals = make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo to summarize, the main corrections are:\n\n- Fix make_sort's function signature.\n- In make_sort_freq, correctly negate the hist using Map and remove the incorrect negation of the sorted values.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 4833, "total_tokens": 9456}}, {"id": "gen-1738411100-I9xOSxHfq0l4G03DH4vw", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411100, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified issues in the `make_sort_freq` function related to incorrect handling of the histogram negation and an invalid operation on an SOp.

That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but the aggregate function in RASP requires a default value. In the current code, it's not provided, so it defaults to None. But in the example, when there's no selection, it should return None. That seems okay, but maybe in some cases, this could cause issues. However, the function is intended for unique keys, so each target_pos should match exactly one index. So perhaps it's fine.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). This function modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. It uses rasp.SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. I don't see an obvious issue here, but let me check the parameters. The function is called with keys, vals, max_seq_len, and min_key. Wait, in the original code, the make_sort function is defined with parameters (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key), but in the function call inside make_sort_freq, it's passed as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with the tokens and this negated histogram as keys. The idea is to sort by frequency, but more frequent tokens come first. However, the current code returns make_sort() multiplied by -1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because make_sort returns an SOp, and multiplying it by -1 isn't valid. Oh, I see, the code has a typo: it says .named(\"sort_freq\") * -1, which is incorrect. Instead, it should apply a Map to multiply by -1. So that's a bug. The correct approach is to take the output of make_sort and then apply a Map to reverse the order, perhaps by multiplying by -1. Alternatively, maybe the negation is already handled correctly, but the way it's applied here is wrong.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_freq(). The line should not multiply the SOp by -1. Instead, perhaps the negation is already applied correctly in the hist variable, so the sort should order correctly without needing to multiply again. Let me think: hist is the frequency count, and it's negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. So when we pass hist as the key to make_sort, which sorts by <, the negated hist will cause the sort to arrange tokens from most frequent to least. So the output of make_sort is already in the correct order. Therefore, the *-1 at the end is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(). But looking at make_hist(), it returns a SelectorWidth, which is an SOp. So multiplying by -1 would require a Map. So the line should be something like rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist). But in the current code, it's written as hist = -1 * make_hist(), which isn't valid because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar directly. So that's another bug.\n\nSo to fix make_sort_freq(), I need to correctly negate the histogram. Instead of hist = -1 * make_hist(), it should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()). Then, pass this hist to make_sort.\n\nPutting it all together, the errors are:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the histogram is negated incorrectly. It should use rasp.Map to apply the negation.\n2. The final return statement incorrectly multiplies the SOp by -1, which isn't valid. Instead, the sorting should already handle the order correctly, so no further multiplication is needed.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() should:\n\n- Compute hist as the negative of make_hist() using Map.\n- Call make_sort with the correct parameters.\n- Return the result without multiplying by -1.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 1942, "total_tokens": 6565}}, {"id": "gen-1738411156-BCIcqgTWTbN93r7RSkWM", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411156, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified issues in the `make_sort_freq` function.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. So target_pos would give the position where each element should be placed in a sorted list. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals using this selector. That should correctly sort the vals based on keys. But wait, the example shows that make_sort is called with [2,4,3,1] and returns [1,2,3,4]. Let me think: the keys are the same as the tokens, so the 'smaller' selector would be True for all positions where the key is less than the current key. The target_pos would be the number of keys smaller than each key, which effectively gives the rank. So when we aggregate, each position in the output takes the value from the position where its rank matches the index. That makes sense. So make_sort_unique seems correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). This function is supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique using max_seq_len and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique because the index adds a small value. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That should handle ties correctly. For example, if two keys are the same, their modified keys would be slightly different, so their order is preserved based on their original positions. Wait, but in the example given, when keys are [2,4,1,2], the output is [1,2,2,4]. So the modified keys would be 2 + 1*0/5=2, 4 +1*1/5=4.2, 1 +1*2/5=1.4, 2 +1*3/5=2.6. So when sorted, the order would be 1.4, 2, 2.6, 4.2, which corresponds to indices 2,0,3,1. So the vals would be [1,2,2,4], which matches the example. So make_sort seems correct.\n\nFinally, make_sort_freq(). It's supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. It first computes the histogram, which is the count of each token. Then it negates the histogram so that higher frequencies come first when sorted. It then uses make_sort with these negated hist as keys. Wait, but in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,1,1] (assuming make_hist returns [2,1,2,1], but wait no, make_hist returns for each position the count of that token. So for input [2,4,2,1], the hist would be [2,1,2,1]. So when negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when sorted, the keys would be ordered from smallest to largest, but since they are negated, it's from most frequent to least. Wait, no: when you sort by the key in ascending order, the most negative comes first. So the sorted order would be based on the negated hist. Let me see: the keys are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. So when sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1. So the original indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So why is there a * -1 at the end? Oh, because the make_sort returns the sorted tokens, but the negation was only for the keys. The output is the tokens sorted by their frequency. So the * -1 is not needed because the hist was negated to make the sort order correct. Wait, no, the * -1 is applied to the output of make_sort. Let me see: the make_sort returns the tokens sorted based on the negated hist. So the tokens are ordered from most frequent to least. But the * -1 would multiply each token by -1, which is incorrect. For example, in the example, the output would be [2,2,4,1], but after * -1, it becomes [-2,-2,-4,-1], which is wrong. So that's a bug.\n\nSo the mistake is in make_sort_freq(). The line returns make_sort(...) * -1, which is incorrect. It should not multiply by -1 because the sorting is based on the negated histogram, but the output should be the original tokens, not their negatives. So the * -1 should be removed.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). But make_hist() returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Wait, no, in RASP, you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar directly. So that line is incorrect. Instead, we should apply a Map to negate each element.\n\nSo the correct approach is to create a new SOp that applies a lambda to each element of the histogram, negating it. So instead of hist = -1 * make_hist(), it should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()). \n\nSo to fix make_sort_freq(), I need to change the hist computation and remove the * -1 at the end.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), replace hist = -1 * make_hist()... with hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).\n\n2. Remove the * -1 at the end of the return statement.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\"))\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but the original code had hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar. So using Map is the correct way.\n\nSo putting it all together, the functions make_hist, make_sort_unique, and make_sort are correct, but make_sort_freq has two issues: incorrect negation and an unnecessary multiplication.\n\nSo the final step is to correct these two issues in make_sort_freq.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2285, "total_tokens": 6908}}, {"id": "gen-1738411230-XcBYxPk2JEtZh4R4JwcD", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411230, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified that the `make_sort_freq` function incorrectly multiplied the sorted tokens by -1, which altered their values instead of just ordering them.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct because each token's count is the number of times it appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector where each element is true if keys[i] < keys[j]. Then `target_pos` is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position, which gives the position where each element should be placed. Then it selects elements where the target position equals the index and aggregates. This should correctly sort the values based on keys. I don't see an issue here.\n\nNow, looking at `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. The function modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. It uses `rasp.SequenceMap` to add `min_key * i / max_seq_len` to each key. The idea is to break ties by the position. But wait, the original code has `keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...)`, which reassigns the keys variable. Then it calls `make_sort_unique` with these new keys. That should work, but let me check the parameters. Oh, wait, in the function definition, the parameters are `vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp`, but in the call to `make_sort_unique`, it's passing `keys` as the second argument. That's correct because `make_sort_unique` expects `keys` as the second parameter. So this seems okay.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. The function computes the histogram, negates it, and uses it as the key for sorting. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency (lower negative hist) come first. But wait, in the example, after negation, the hist becomes negative, so sorting in ascending order would place higher frequencies first. Then, the sorted tokens are multiplied by -1. Hmm, that might not be necessary. Let me think: the hist is the count, so for [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1]. Negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order based on these keys, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to the original indices 0,2,1,3. So the sorted tokens would be [2,2,4,1]. But the example expects [2,2,4,1], which matches. However, the code returns `make_sort(...)*-1`. Wait, that would multiply each token by -1, which isn't correct because tokens are integers. Oh, that's a mistake. The function should return the sorted tokens, not multiply them by -1. So the error is in the return statement where it has `.named(\"sort_freq\") * -1`. That's incorrect because it's changing the token values, not the order. So I need to remove the `* -1` part.\n\nSo the main issue is in `make_sort_freq()`. The function incorrectly multiplies the result by -1, which alters the token values instead of just sorting them. The correct approach is to remove that multiplication.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any possible issues. In `make_sort`, when creating new keys, the lambda is `x + min_key * i / max_seq_len`. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. That should work as intended.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in `make_sort_freq`, the `hist` is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency come first. That part is correct.\n\nSo the only repair needed is in `make_sort_freq()`, where the return statement shouldn't multiply by -1.

Let me go through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is then created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position exactly once. That should correctly sort the values. Hmm, maybe this is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the function signature in the original code is incorrect. The parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key), but in the example usage, make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function definition should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments. But in the code, the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp: which is correct. So that's fine.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the make_sort function's example usage shows make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), but the function expects four arguments. Oh, no, wait, the function is defined with max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only, so the example should pass them as keyword arguments. But in the example, it's called positionally. That might be a problem. So the function signature should allow positional or keyword arguments. Alternatively, the example usage is incorrect. But the user probably can't change the example, so perhaps the function should accept the arguments positionally. So I need to adjust the function parameters to have default values or make them positional.\n\nWait, looking at the original code, the function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nWhich means max_seq_len and min_key must be passed as keyword arguments. But in the example, they are passed positionally. That would cause a TypeError. So to fix this, I should remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key positional parameters with default values. Alternatively, set default values for them.\n\nWait, but the function is called in make_sort_freq as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So in that case, it's correct. But in the example usage, the user might have called it incorrectly. So perhaps the function should have default values for max_seq_len and min_key, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, the function should accept the parameters without the *.\n\nSo I think the issue is that the function signature is incorrect. It should not have the * because the example usage passes max_seq_len and min_key positionally. So I'll remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key positional parameters with default values, perhaps.\n\nWait, but in the example, make_sort is called with four arguments. So the function should accept four positional arguments. So the correct signature should be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the original code, the * is present, which forces the last two arguments to be keyword-only. So that's a problem. So I need to fix the function signature by removing the *.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort, when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so for each position i, it's adding a small value to the key to break ties. That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with the tokens and the negated histogram as keys. But wait, the histogram counts the frequency of each token. So when we negate it, the more frequent tokens have lower values, so when sorted in ascending order, they come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). So the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the return statement is:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWait, no. The code in the original is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nmake_sort_freq() is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because make_sort returns an SOp, and then multiplying by -1 would not be possible because SOp doesn't support that operation. So this is an error. Instead, the code should apply a Map to multiply by -1.\n\nSo the mistake is that the return statement tries to multiply the SOp by -1, which is invalid. Instead, it should use rasp.Map to apply the negation.\n\nSo the correct code should be:\n\nreturn rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_sort(...)).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hist is being negated, and then the sort is done, and then the result is negated again. But that might not be necessary. Let me think.\n\nWait, the hist is the frequency count. So for the input [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,1,1]. Then hist is negated to [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, when sorting, the keys are these negative frequencies. So the sort is in ascending order, so the most negative (highest frequency) comes first. So the sorted order would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nBut after sorting, the code tries to multiply by -1 again, which would flip the order. Wait, no, because the sort is based on the keys, which are the negative frequencies. The values being sorted are the tokens. So after sorting, the tokens are in the order of highest frequency first. Then, applying *-1 to the SOp doesn't make sense because it's not a numerical operation but an SOp.\n\nSo the error is that the code does .named(\"sort_freq\") * -1, which is invalid. Instead, it should not multiply by -1 because the sorting is already based on the negated frequencies. So the correct code should just return the make_sort result without the multiplication.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. The hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency come first. So the make_sort function sorts the tokens based on the negated hist. So the output is the tokens sorted by their frequency in descending order. So the final step of multiplying by -1 is incorrect because it's applied to the sorted tokens, not the keys. So that line is wrong and should be removed.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq should be:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the multiplication by -1 was intended to invert the sort order, but that's not necessary because the hist is already negated.\n\nSo the main issues I found are:\n\n1. The make_sort function's parameters are defined with a *, making max_seq_len and min_key keyword-only, but the example usage and other calls pass them positionally. So the function signature should be adjusted.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, the return statement incorrectly tries to multiply an SOp by -1, which is not allowed. Instead, it should just return the sorted SOp without modification.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all functions are using the correct operations and that there are no other syntax errors.\n\nSo, to fix these:\n\n- Modify make_sort's function signature to remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key positional parameters.\n\n- In make_sort_freq, remove the * -1 at the end and instead use a Map if necessary, but in this case, it's not needed because the sort is already correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. So the make_sort function sorts the tokens based on the negated hist. So the output is the tokens in the order of highest frequency to lowest. So the final multiplication by -1 is incorrect because it's applied to the tokens, not the keys. So we should remove that part.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    sorted_tokens = make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n    return sorted_tokens\n\nWait, but in the original code, the return statement is:\n\nreturn make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\") * -1\n\nWhich is incorrect. So I need to correct that.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort, when creating the new keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so for each position i, it's adding a small value to the key to ensure uniqueness. That should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the changes needed are:\n\n1. Fix the function signature of make_sort to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments.\n\n2. Fix make_sort_freq by removing the multiplication by -1 and correctly returning the sorted tokens.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort, the function should have a default value for min_key and max_seq_len, but the example shows that they are passed explicitly. So perhaps the function should have default values, but the original code doesn't. Alternatively, the function can be called with the parameters as positional.\n\nWait, in the original code, the function is called in make_sort_freq as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So the function expects max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. But the function is defined with * which forces them to be keyword-only. So the function signature is correct in that case. But the example usage in the docstring shows make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which would pass max_seq_len as positional, which is not allowed because of the *. So that's a problem.\n\nSo to fix this, the function should not have the * and max_seq_len and min_key should be positional parameters. So the function signature should be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut then, in the example, it's called correctly. However, in make_sort_freq, it's called with keyword arguments, which is still acceptable.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main corrections are:\n\n- Fix make_sort's function signature.\n\n- Fix make_sort_freq's return statement.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3353, "total_tokens": 7976}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
