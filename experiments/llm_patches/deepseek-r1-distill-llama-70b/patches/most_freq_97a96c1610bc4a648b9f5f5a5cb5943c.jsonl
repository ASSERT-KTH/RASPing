Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos is not equal to indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position is based on how many are smaller. So for the first element (2), there's one element smaller (1), so target_pos is 1. So sel_new would select where target_pos != indices. So for each position, it selects the position where the index matches target_pos. Then aggregate picks the value from vals at that position. That should correctly sort the values. Hmm, maybe this is correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, when calling make_sort, it's passed as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments. But looking at the code, the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the make_sort function is defined with max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments after *? Or is it using keyword-only arguments? Let me check the code again. Oh, in the provided code, the function is written as:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nYes, that's correct. So when calling, the user must pass them as keyword arguments. But in the example usage, the user did make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which would treat 5 and 1 as positional arguments, which would cause an error because the function expects them as keyword-only. So that's a problem. The example usage is incorrect, but the function definition is correct. So perhaps the function should be adjusted to accept them as positional or keyword.\n\nAlternatively, in the function definition, perhaps the parameters should be max_seq_len: int = None and min_key: float = None, and then handle default values. But looking at the code, the function doesn't have default values. So when the user calls make_sort with positional arguments, it would throw an error. So to fix this, the function should have default values, or the example should use keyword arguments.\n\nWait, but the user's example shows make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which would pass 5 as max_seq_len and 1 as min_key. But since in the function, they are keyword-only, this would cause a TypeError. So the function definition is incorrect. It should either not have the * and accept positional arguments or adjust the example.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the task is to repair the RASP program. So perhaps the function definitions are incorrect. Let me think: in Python, to have keyword-only arguments after a *, the function must be called with those arguments as keywords. So in the example, the user should call make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1). But the example shows it being called positionally, which is wrong. So the function's parameters are incorrectly defined. They should not be keyword-only. Alternatively, perhaps the function should accept them as positional.\n\nSo to fix this, I should remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key positional parameters. Or, if they are intended to be keyword-only, then the example is wrong, but the function is correct. But since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function should be adjusted.\n\nWait, looking back at the code, the make_sort function is defined with the * and max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only. So when the example calls it with positional arguments, it's incorrect. So the function should be modified to not have the * and accept them as positional. Alternatively, the example should be fixed, but since the task is to repair the program, I'll adjust the function.\n\nSo I'll change the function signature to:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut wait, that would make them positional, which may not be desired. Alternatively, perhaps the function should have default values. But the problem says that in make_x functions, if they have additional parameters, they should have default values. So perhaps adding default values would be better.\n\nLooking at the code, the make_sort function does not have default values for max_seq_len and min_key. So when the user calls it without them, it would error. So to fix this, I should add default values. For example, max_seq_len=0 and min_key=0. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, set them to None and handle internally. But the function uses them in the keys modification, so they can't be None. Hmm, perhaps the function should have default values that make sense. For example, max_seq_len could default to 0, but in the code, it's used as a divisor, so 0 would cause division by zero. So perhaps it's better to make them required parameters without defaults, but then the function should be called correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial code is correct, and the example is wrong. So in the example, the user should call make_sort with keyword arguments. But the example shows it being called with positional. So perhaps the function is correct, but the example is wrong. But since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function should be adjusted to accept positional arguments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not have the * and allow positional arguments. So I'll remove the * in the function definition.\n\nSo the corrected function would be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut then, in the example, the call would be correct as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So that would fix the issue.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It creates a histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with tokens and hist. Wait, hist is the negative of the histogram. So when sorting, lower hist (more negative) would come first, meaning higher frequency tokens come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] would have hist [2,1,2,1], so negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then sorted by these keys. So the sorted order would be based on the keys [-2, -1, -2, -1]. So the sorted indices would be [1,3,0,2], so the output would be [4,1,2,2]. But the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that's different. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, the make_sort_freq function is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. So tokens with higher frequency come first. In the example, 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the output should be [2,2,4,1]. But according to the current code, hist is made by make_hist(), which returns the count. Then it's negated, so hist becomes [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then make_sort is called with keys=hist. So when sorting, the keys are [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order because it's using the 'smaller' comparison (LT). So the sorted order would be based on the keys from smallest to largest. So the keys are -2, -1, -2, -1. So the order would be sorted as the indices where the key is smallest first. So the first key is -2 (index 0), then -2 (index 2), then -1 (index 1), then -1 (index 3). So the sorted indices would be [0,2,1,3], so the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So why is the code incorrect?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine. The make_sort function uses the keys to determine the order. So when the keys are [-2,-1,-2,-1], the make_sort function will sort the tokens in the order of the keys from smallest to largest. So the smallest key is -2, so the first elements would be the ones with key -2, which are indices 0 and 2. Then the next key is -1, which are indices 1 and 3. So the sorted order would be [0,2,1,3], so the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, when it calls make_sort_unique, it's using the modified keys. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram. So the sorting is based on the negative histogram, which effectively sorts by frequency in descending order. So the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So in make_sort_freq, min_key is 1, and max_seq_len is passed as a parameter. So for each position i, the key is x + 1 * i / max_seq_len. So for the example where the input is [2,4,2,1], the keys after modification would be:\n\nOriginal hist: [2,1,2,1]\nNegated: [-2,-1,-2,-1]\nThen, for each i (0,1,2,3), add 1*i/max_seq_len. Let's say max_seq_len is 4 (since the input has 4 elements). So:\n\nFor i=0: -2 + 0/4 = -2.0\ni=1: -1 + 1/4 = -0.75\ni=2: -2 + 2/4 = -1.5\ni=3: -1 + 3/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the modified keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -1.5, -0.25]\n\nNow, when sorting, the keys are compared. So the order from smallest to largest would be:\n\n-2.0 (i=0), -1.5 (i=2), -0.75 (i=1), -0.25 (i=3)\n\nSo the sorted indices are [0,2,1,3], so the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo why is the code incorrect? Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the make_sort_freq function, it's defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(5). So the function expects max_seq_len, which is used in make_sort. But in the code, the function is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, no, in the code provided, the make_sort_freq function is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nBut the make_sort function expects max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments, but in the code, they are passed as keyword arguments. So if the make_sort function is defined with max_seq_len and min_key as positional, this would cause an error. So that's another issue.\n\nWait, in the initial code, make_sort is defined with max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments. So when make_sort_freq calls make_sort with max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments, it's correct. But earlier, I thought that the function definition was incorrect because the example called it with positional arguments. So perhaps the function is correct, and the example is wrong. But the task is to repair the program, so perhaps the function definitions need to be fixed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_sort function should accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments, not keyword-only. So I'll adjust the function definition.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort, when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so i is 0-based. So for each position, the key is x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. But if max_seq_len is the maximum sequence length, and i ranges from 0 to max_seq_len-1, then the addition is a small value to break ties. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each element, the key is unique because i is unique. So when sorting, the order is determined first by the original key, then by the index. So that ensures that when two keys are equal, the one with the smaller index comes first. Which is correct for stable sorting.\n\nSo perhaps the functions are correct, but the way they are called is incorrect. Or maybe there's another issue.\n\nWait, looking at the make_sort_unique function again. It creates 'smaller' as a selector where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each key. Then sel_new is where target_pos is not equal to indices. So for each position i, sel_new selects the position where target_pos[j] != i. Wait, no. The Select is between target_pos and rasp.indices with Comparison.NEQ. So for each row i (which is each element in target_pos), it's comparing to each index j. So the selector sel_new has True where target_pos[i] != j. Then, when aggregating, for each i, it's taking the value from vals where j == target_pos[i]. Because the selector is True where j != target_pos[i], so the aggregate would sum over the False cases, which is where j == target_pos[i]. Wait, no. The Aggregate function uses the selector to weight the sop. So for each row i, it's taking the sum of sop[j] where selector[i][j] is True, divided by the number of True's. But in this case, the selector is target_pos != indices, which is True for all j except j = target_pos[i]. So the aggregate would sum over all j where j != target_pos[i], but since the default is None, it would set the result to None. That can't be right.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The Aggregate function takes a selector and an sop. For each row i, it computes the average of sop[j] for all j where selector[i][j] is True. If no j is selected, it uses the default, which is None.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the selector sel_new is created as where target_pos != indices. So for each i, sel_new[i][j] is True if target_pos[i] != j. So when we aggregate, for each i, we're summing over all j where target_pos[i] != j. But target_pos[i] is the number of elements smaller than i. So for each i, the aggregate would sum all elements except the one at j = target_pos[i]. That doesn't make sense because we want to select the element at position target_pos[i].\n\nWait, that's the mistake. The sel_new is incorrectly selecting where target_pos != indices. Instead, it should select where indices == target_pos. Because for each i, we want to select the j where j is the target position, which is target_pos[i]. So the selector should be where indices == target_pos[i] for each row i.\n\nSo the correct selector should be created using rasp.Comparison.EQ, not NEQ. So the line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBecause for each row i, we want to select the column j where j equals target_pos[i]. Then, when aggregating, each row i will pick the value from vals at position target_pos[i], which is the correct sorted position.\n\nSo that's the bug in make_sort_unique. The selector is using NEQ instead of EQ, which causes it to select all positions except the target, leading to incorrect aggregation.\n\nSo to fix this, I need to change the selector in make_sort_unique from using NEQ to EQ.\n\nLet me summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the selector sel_new is created with Comparison.NEQ, which is incorrect. It should be EQ.\n\n2. The function make_sort is defined with max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments, which may cause issues when called positionally. But according to the problem statement, functions should have default parameters if they have additional ones. So perhaps adding default values would be better, but the current code doesn't have them. However, the example calls make_sort with positional arguments, which would fail if the function expects them as keyword-only.\n\nSo to fix the first issue, I'll correct the selector in make_sort_unique. For the second issue, I'll adjust the function signature to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments, possibly with default values.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if functions have additional parameters, they should have default values. So perhaps I should add default values to max_seq_len and min_key in make_sort. For example, max_seq_len=0 and min_key=0, but that might not be suitable. Alternatively, set them to None and handle internally, but that complicates things. Alternatively, make them required parameters without defaults, but then the function must be called correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not have the * and accept them as positional. So I'll remove the * in the function definition.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function would be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nAnd the make_sort_freq function would call it as:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1)\n\nBut wait, in the code, make_sort_freq is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nSo if make_sort is adjusted to take max_seq_len and min_key as positional, then the call should be:\n\nmake_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1)\n\nBut in the current code, it's passed as keyword arguments. So that would cause an error. So to fix this, the call should be adjusted to pass them positionally.\n\nAlternatively, if the function is changed to accept them as keyword-only, then the call is correct. But the example usage in the code is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me focus on the main issue: the selector in make_sort_unique is incorrect.\n\nSo, to fix the program, I'll correct the selector in make_sort_unique to use EQ instead of NEQ.\n\nAdditionally, I'll adjust the function signatures to ensure that parameters are correctly passed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, change sel_new to use EQ.\n\n2. Ensure that make_sort's parameters are correctly handled, possibly removing the * to allow positional arguments.\n\n3. Verify that all function calls are correct after these changes.\n\nLet me apply these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 5230, "total_tokens": 9849}}, {"id": "gen-1738410529-oe5S5OR24pj6P4gX0FM4", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410529, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was incorrectly using the NEQ comparison.

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the `make_hist` function. It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses `rasp.Select` with EQ comparison and then `SelectorWidth`. That seems correct because it creates a selector where each element [i,j] is True if token i equals token j. Then, `SelectorWidth` counts the number of Trues in each row, which gives the frequency. So I think `make_hist` is fine.\n\nNext, the `make_sort_unique` function. It's intended to sort values based on keys, assuming unique keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector where each row i has True for all j where key j is less than key i. Then, `SelectorWidth` gives the number of elements smaller than each key, which is the position where each element should be placed. Then it creates a selector `sel_new` where each position i selects the element j where j's target position is not equal to i. Finally, it aggregates vals using this selector. Hmm, wait. The way it's selecting might not correctly pick the right element. Let me think: for each position i in the output, we want the element j where j's target position is i. So the selector should be True where target_pos[j] == i. But currently, `sel_new` is using NEQ, which might be the opposite. Oh, right, because `rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ)` would select elements where target_pos[j] is not equal to i. That's not what we want. We need to select where target_pos[j] equals i. So the predicate should be EQ, not NEQ. So that's a bug. I'll need to change that.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort`. This function adjusts the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. It then calls `make_sort_unique` with these adjusted keys. The adjustment is done using `SequenceMap` to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. That seems correct because it ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. So I don't see an issue here.\n\nNow, `make_sort_freq` is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency. It first computes the histogram (frequency) using `make_hist`, then negates it so that higher frequencies come first. Then it uses `make_sort` with these negated frequencies as keys. Wait, but in `make_sort`, the keys are being adjusted by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. However, in `make_sort_freq`, the keys are the negated histogram, which is a SOp. So when `make_sort` is called, it's using these as the keys. But in `make_sort`, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But wait, the min_key is set to 1 in `make_sort_freq`, which might not be appropriate because the histogram could have varying values. Also, the way the keys are adjusted might not correctly order the tokens by frequency. Let me think: when sorting by frequency, tokens with higher frequency should come first. So the keys are the negative frequencies, so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. But when `make_sort` adjusts the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len, it's modifying the keys, which could interfere with the sorting order. Because the adjustment is based on the position, which might not preserve the frequency order. For example, if two tokens have the same frequency, their adjusted keys would be different, but their original order should be preserved. However, the adjustment in `make_sort` is meant to break ties, but in `make_sort_freq`, the tie-breaker should be the original position to maintain stability. So perhaps the way the keys are being adjusted in `make_sort` is correct, but I'm not sure if the parameters are being passed correctly.\n\nWait, looking at `make_sort_freq`, it calls `make_sort` with `hist` as the keys. But in `make_sort`, the function expects `keys` to be a SOp, which it is. Then, `make_sort` creates new keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in `make_sort_freq`, min_key is set to 1. So for each token, its key becomes (-frequency) + (1 * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that when frequencies are the same, the token with the smaller index comes first, which is correct for stable sorting. So that part seems okay.\n\nBut wait, in `make_sort`, the function is defined as `def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:`. But in `make_sort_freq`, it's called as `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)`. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the original `make_sort` function, the `keys` parameter is being overwritten. The function starts with `keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...)`, which shadows the input `keys`. That's a problem because the input `keys` is the histogram, but then it's being reassigned to the adjusted keys. So the function is not using the input `keys` correctly. Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nWait, yes, the function takes `keys` as an argument, then immediately reassigns `keys` to a new SOp. So that's correct because it's using the input `keys` to create the new adjusted keys. So that part is okay.\n\nBut going back to `make_sort_unique`, the issue is with the selector `sel_new`. It's using `rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)`, which is checking where target_pos[j] is not equal to i. But we want to select the j where target_pos[j] equals i. So the predicate should be EQ, not NEQ. So that's a bug. So in `make_sort_unique`, the line `sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)` should be changed to EQ.\n\nAnother thing to check: in `make_sort_unique`, the `rasp.Aggregate` is called with `sel_new` and `vals`. Since `sel_new` is a selector where each row i has exactly one True (because keys are unique), the aggregate will pick the corresponding value from `vals`. That should correctly sort the values.\n\nSo the main issue is in `make_sort_unique` where the selector is using NEQ instead of EQ.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other issues.\n\nIn `make_sort_freq`, the `hist` is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. That makes sense because `make_sort` sorts based on the keys in ascending order.\n\nWait, no. `make_sort` sorts the `vals` based on the `keys` in ascending order. So if the keys are the negative frequencies, then higher frequencies (which are more negative) will come first. Wait, no: for example, if frequency is 3, the key is -3. If another token has frequency 2, key is -2. So when sorted in ascending order, -3 comes before -2, so the token with frequency 3 comes first. That's correct.\n\nSo the only bug is in `make_sort_unique` where the selector is using NEQ instead of EQ.\n\nSo to fix the code, I need to change the predicate in `sel_new` from NEQ to EQ.\n\nLet me also check if there are any other issues. For example, in `make_sort`, when adjusting the keys, it's using `rasp.SequenceMap` with `keys` and `rasp.indices`. That should correctly add the min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nAnother thing: in `make_sort_freq`, the `hist` is multiplied by -1. So the keys are the negative frequencies. Then, `make_sort` sorts these keys in ascending order, which places higher frequencies first. That's correct.\n\nSo the main fix is in `make_sort_unique`.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In `make_sort_unique`, change the `rasp.Comparison.NEQ` to `rasp.Comparison.EQ` in the `sel_new` selector.\n\nThat should fix the sorting issue.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with this change.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2680, "total_tokens": 7299}}, {"id": "gen-1738410626-ou72EBuoDbpeW4QIFURm", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410626, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and addressed them:\n\n1. **make_sort_unique()**: The selector `sel_new` was using `NEQ` instead of `EQ`, which incorrectly selected elements.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to create a selector and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears by checking equality across all tokens. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the count of smaller elements, which gives the position each key should move to. The sel_new selector is created by checking if target_pos is not equal to indices, which might be incorrect. Wait, the original intent is to select the correct position for each element. Maybe the selector should be based on equality instead of NEQ. Because for each target_pos, we want to select the index that matches it. So using EQ would make more sense. Using NEQ here would select all positions except the target, which doesn't seem right. So I think this is a bug. The sel_new should be created with EQ comparison.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should double-check the parameters. The function is called with keys, vals, max_seq_len, and min_key. Wait, in the original code, the make_sort function is defined with max_seq_len and min_key, but in the example usage, make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the parameters are correct.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it to sort in ascending order of frequency, and then uses make_sort. But wait, the example shows that tokens with the same frequency should appear in the same order as the input. However, the current approach might not preserve the original order for ties because it's using make_sort, which might not handle duplicates correctly. Also, when creating hist, it's multiplied by -1, which might not be necessary if the sort is handled correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the keys should be adjusted to include the original indices to break ties.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated and passed as keys to make_sort. So tokens with higher frequency (more negative hist) will come first. But when frequencies are the same, the sort might not preserve the order because the keys are the same. To fix this, the keys should include both the frequency and the original position so that when frequencies are equal, the original order is maintained. So I need to modify the keys in make_sort_freq to include the index as a secondary key.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the sel_new selector is using NEQ, which is incorrect. It should use EQ to select the correct target positions.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, the keys should be a combination of the negative histogram and the original indices. This way, when frequencies are the same, the tokens are sorted by their original positions, thus preserving the input order for ties.\n\nSo, for make_sort_unique, I'll change the selector comparison from NEQ to EQ.\n\nFor make_sort_freq, I'll adjust the keys to include both the negative histogram and the index. I can do this by using rasp.SequenceMap to create a tuple of (-hist, index), but since RASP might not handle tuples directly, perhaps I can encode it as a single value. Alternatively, I can add the index as a secondary term in the key. For example, key = -hist + (index * epsilon), where epsilon is a small value to ensure uniqueness without affecting the primary sort key. But since max_seq_len is provided, I can scale the index appropriately.\n\nWait, in make_sort, the function already takes max_seq_len and min_key to ensure unique keys. So in make_sort_freq, I can create a new key that combines the histogram and the index. Let me think: the primary key is the negative histogram (so higher frequencies come first), and the secondary key is the index (to maintain order for ties).\n\nSo, I'll create a new key by adding the index scaled by a factor that makes it smaller than the differences in histogram counts. For example, key = (-hist) + (index / max_seq_len). This way, for the same hist value, the index will determine the order, but the impact is minimal to not affect the primary sorting by frequency.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Fix make_sort_unique by changing the selector to use EQ.\n- Modify make_sort_freq to create a combined key of (-hist) and index.\n\nLet me write the corrected code step by step.\n\nFirst, in make_sort_unique, the sel_new is created with rasp.Comparison.NEQ. I'll change that to EQ.\n\nSecond, in make_sort_freq, after computing hist, I'll create a new key that combines -hist with the index. So:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nnegative_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\nindex = rasp.indices\ncombined_key = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + i / max_seq_len, negative_hist, index)\nThen, pass combined_key to make_sort.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq is using hist = -1 * make_hist(), which is the same as negative_hist. So I can adjust that part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to create the combined key within make_sort_freq before calling make_sort.\n\nSo, the revised make_sort_freq would look like:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    negative_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    index = rasp.indices\n    # Combine negative histogram with index to break ties\n    combined_key = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len), negative_hist, index\n    )\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, combined_key, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but the make_sort function expects keys and vals. So in this case, the keys are the combined_key, and vals are rasp.tokens.\n\nThis should ensure that when frequencies are the same, the tokens are ordered by their original positions.\n\nSo, to summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, change the selector comparison from NEQ to EQ.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq, modify the keys to include both the negative histogram and the index to preserve order for ties.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2298, "total_tokens": 6917}}, {"id": "gen-1738410723-Gu6OvfQB6T6KSasK5rjP", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410723, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was incorrectly using `NEQ` instead of `EQ`.

So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by checking if target_pos is not equal to indices. Then it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position is its index. So sel_new would select where target_pos != indices, which would be all except the diagonal. But when aggregating, it's taking the average of vals where the selector is true. But in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which suggests that each position is taking the value from the correct sorted position. Hmm, maybe the logic is correct, but perhaps the way the selector is used in Aggregate is wrong. Because Aggregate averages the selected values, but in sorting, we just want to pick the correct value, not average. Oh wait, that's a problem. So using Aggregate here might not be the right approach because it's averaging, but we need to select the single correct value. So this function is flawed.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique, then calls make_sort_unique. But since make_sort_unique is incorrect, this will also be wrong.\n\nThen make_sort_freq(). It calculates the negative histogram to use as keys for sorting. But again, since make_sort_unique is broken, this function won't work as intended.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique. The function is trying to sort by selecting elements where the key is smaller, but the way it's using Aggregate is incorrect because it's averaging instead of selecting the correct single element.\n\nI need to fix make_sort_unique. Let me think about how to correctly implement sorting.\n\nIn RASP, to sort, each position should select the element from the original sequence that has the correct rank. So for each position i, we need to find the element in vals where the key is the i-th smallest.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute for each position i, the number of elements less than or equal to the key at i, which gives the rank. Then, create a selector that selects the element at that rank.\n\nWait, but how to compute that. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach is to create a selector where for each target position i, we select the element j where j is the i-th smallest. To do this, we can compute for each j, the number of elements less than or equal to key j, which gives the rank of j. Then, for each i, we select the j where rank j equals i.\n\nBut how to translate this into RASP operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original approach in the RASP paper used a different method. Let me recall. In the paper, they might have used a composition of selectors to break ties, but the current implementation avoids that by modifying the keys to be unique.\n\nWait, in the current make_sort_unique, the 'smaller' selector is created as keys < keys. Then target_pos is the count of smaller, which for each position j gives the number of elements less than key j. So target_pos[j] is the number of keys less than key j, which would be the rank of j in the sorted order.\n\nThen, sel_new is created by checking if target_pos is not equal to indices. So for each row i, it's selecting all j where target_pos[j] != i. Wait, no. The selector is (target_pos, indices) with NEQ. So for each i, it's selecting j where target_pos[j] != i. So when we aggregate vals with this selector, for each i, it's averaging all vals[j] where target_pos[j] != i. That doesn't make sense because we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nAh, so the problem is that sel_new is using NEQ instead of EQ. So the current selector is selecting all j where target_pos[j] is not equal to i, which is the opposite of what we need. So the Aggregate is averaging all the wrong elements, leading to incorrect results.\n\nSo to fix this, sel_new should be created using EQ instead of NEQ. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nshould be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThat way, for each i, it selects the j where target_pos[j] == i, which is exactly the j that should be placed at position i in the sorted output.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example. Suppose keys are [2,4,3,1]. The target_pos for each j would be:\n\nj=0: key=2. Number of keys less than 2 is 1 (only key 1). So target_pos[0]=1.\n\nj=1: key=4. Number of keys less than 4 is 3. So target_pos[1]=3.\n\nj=2: key=3. Number of keys less than 3 is 2. So target_pos[2]=2.\n\nj=3: key=1. Number of keys less than 1 is 0. So target_pos[3]=0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0].\n\nNow, for each i in 0 to 3, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\ni=0: j=3 (target_pos[3]=0). So val is 1.\n\ni=1: j=0 (target_pos[0]=1). So val is 2.\n\ni=2: j=2 (target_pos[2]=2). So val is 3.\n\ni=3: j=1 (target_pos[1]=3). So val is 4.\n\nSo the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nIn the current code, sel_new is using NEQ, so it's selecting all j where target_pos[j] != i. So for i=0, it's selecting j=0,1,2. The aggregate would average vals[0], vals[1], vals[2], which is (2+4+3)/3 = 3, which is wrong. So changing to EQ should fix this.\n\nSo the fix is to change the Comparison.NEQ to EQ in make_sort_unique.\n\nLet me check the other functions. In make_sort(), it modifies the keys to be unique by adding a term based on their position. This should work because it ensures that all keys are unique, allowing make_sort_unique to function correctly.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), it uses the negative histogram as keys. Since the histogram counts the frequency, using negative makes higher frequencies come first. But when passed to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the tokens will be ordered from least frequent to most. Wait, no. Because make_sort sorts by the keys in ascending order. So using negative histogram would sort from most frequent to least. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, the histogram is the count of each token. So for example, in [2,4,2,1], the histogram is [2,1,2,1]. So hist = -1 * hist gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when sorted in ascending order, the keys would be -2, -2, -1, -1, which correspond to the original tokens 2,2,4,1. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo the make_sort_freq function seems correct as long as make_sort_unique is fixed.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique, where the selector is using NEQ instead of EQ.\n\nI should also check if the Aggregate function in make_sort_unique is correctly used. Since each row of the selector will have exactly one True value (because target_pos is a permutation of 0 to n-1), the Aggregate will pick that single value, effectively selecting it. So using Aggregate with default=None is correct because it will return None if no elements are selected, but in our case, each row selects exactly one element, so it's safe.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the original code, the make_sort function modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that the keys are unique, which is necessary for make_sort_unique to work correctly.\n\nSo, to sum up, the fix is to change the Comparison operator in make_sort_unique from NEQ to EQ.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2725, "total_tokens": 7344}}, {"id": "gen-1738410808-k6rWJOoFT5AA70W6g67Z", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410808, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was incorrectly using `Comparison.NEQ` instead of `Comparison.EQ`.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. The idea is to find the position where each element should go. Then sel_new selects where target_pos is not equal to indices, and aggregates vals based on that selector. Wait, but if the keys are unique, the target_pos should give the correct order. But when using Aggregate, if the selector has only one True per row, it should pick that value. So maybe this is correct, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the example: for [2,4,3,1], the keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector would be True for each key that is less than the current key. So for each position, target_pos is the number of keys smaller than it. For 2, there's 1 (1), so target_pos is 1. For 4, there are 3 (2,3,1), so target_pos is 3. For 3, there are 2 (2,1), so target_pos is 2. For 1, none, so 0. So the target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is where target_pos != indices. Indices are [0,1,2,3]. So for each row, we're selecting all positions where target_pos is not equal to the current index. Then Aggregate picks the vals where this is true. Wait, but how does that sort the values? Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the Aggregate is summing the selected vals, but since each row has only one True, it's picking the correct value. Hmm, maybe this function is correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term based on their position to make them unique. Then calls make_sort_unique. The idea is to break ties by the position. But looking at the code, the keys are being modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x at position i, it adds a small value to make it unique. Then, when sorted, the original order is preserved because the added term is based on position. That makes sense. So this function seems okay.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It computes the histogram, then negates it to sort in ascending order of frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as the keys. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. However, in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1. So the keys become -hist + 1 * i / max_seq_len. But hist is the frequency, so when we negate it, higher frequencies become more negative. Adding a small value based on position would make the keys unique. But when sorting, the primary key is the negative frequency, so lower frequencies come first. Wait, no: when you sort by a key in ascending order, lower values come first. So if the key is -frequency, then higher frequencies (which are more negative) will come first. So the sorting would be in descending order of frequency. But the example given in make_sort_freq is [2,4,2,1], which has frequencies [2,1,2,1]. The hist is [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, the keys after modification would be -2 + 1*0/5 = -2, -1 +1*1/5= -0.8, -2 +1*2/5= -1.6, -1 +1*3/5= -0.6. So the keys are [-2, -0.8, -1.6, -0.6]. Sorting these in ascending order would arrange them as -2, -1.6, -0.8, -0.6. So the order of the original tokens would be [0,2,1,3], which corresponds to tokens [2,2,4,1]. But the example expects [2,2,4,1], which matches. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the input [2,4,2,1] sorted by frequency. So 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorted order is 2,2,4,1. So the code seems to handle that correctly.\n\nBut looking at the code, in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using hist as the keys, but in make_sort, the function expects keys to be numerical. Since hist is a count, it's numerical, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So in make_sort_freq, min_key is 1, which is correct because we're adding a small value to each key to ensure uniqueness.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Let me check the function definitions again.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But when it's called, it's supposed to return a function that takes tokens? Or is it a higher-order function? Looking at the example, sort = make_sort_freq(5); sort([2,4,2,1]) returns [2,2,4,1]. So make_sort_freq returns a function that takes the input sequence. So in the code, make_sort_freq returns make_sort(...).named(\"sort_freq\"). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the make_sort function is called with vals=rasp.tokens, keys=hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1. So the keys are the hist, which is the frequency. So when sorted, the tokens are ordered by their frequency.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each token's frequency (which is the key), we add a small value based on its position. This ensures that when frequencies are the same, the token that appears earlier comes first. So in the example, the two 2's have the same frequency, but the first one is at position 0, the second at position 2. So their modified keys would be -2 + 0*1/5 = -2, and -2 + 2*1/5 = -1.6. So when sorted in ascending order, -2 comes before -1.6, so the first 2 comes before the second 2. Wait, no: in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the order of the input. So the first 2 is at position 0, the second at position 2. So in the sorted output, the first 2 should come before the second 2 because their keys are -2 and -1.6. So in the sorted order, the key -2 is smaller than -1.6, so the first 2 comes first. So the output is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the keys are being modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for x = -2 (frequency), i=0: -2 + 0 = -2. For i=2: -2 + 2*1/5 = -1.6. So when sorted in ascending order, -2 comes before -1.6, so the first 2 is placed before the second 2. So the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo what's the problem? Maybe the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the hist is being negated, but when used as keys, the sorting is done correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in make_sort, the function is expecting the keys to be such that when sorted in ascending order, the vals are correctly ordered. But I'm not seeing an obvious bug.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is in the make_sort_unique function. Let me think about how it works. It computes 'smaller' as the selector where each key is less than another. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each key. So for each position i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than key[i]. So when we sort, each element should move to the position target_pos[i]. But how does the Aggregate function work here?\n\nThe Aggregate function takes a selector and an SOP. For each row in the selector, it sums the SOP's elements where the selector is True, divided by the number of True elements. But in this case, the selector is sel_new, which is where target_pos != indices. So for each row i, it's selecting all j where target_pos[j] != i. Wait, no: the selector is created as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, Comparison.NEQ). So for each row j, it's checking if target_pos[j] != i (where i is the row index). So the selector is a matrix where element (i,j) is True if target_pos[j] != i. Then, when we Aggregate, for each row i, we're summing all vals[j] where target_pos[j] != i, but that doesn't make sense because we want to pick the val where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, that's the problem! The current code is creating a selector where target_pos != indices, but we should be selecting where target_pos == indices. Because for each position i in the output, we want to select the element j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ) is incorrect. It should be EQ instead of NEQ. Because we want to select the positions where target_pos equals the current index.\n\nFor example, in the [2,4,3,1] case, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for output index 0, we need to select the element where target_pos[j] == 0, which is j=3 (value 1). For index 1, select j where target_pos[j]==1, which is j=0 (value 2). For index 2, j=2 (value3). For index3, j=1 (value4). So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. But with the current selector using NEQ, it's selecting all j where target_pos[j] != i, which would include all except the correct j. So when aggregating, it's summing all vals except the correct one, which is wrong.\n\nSo the fix is to change the Comparison.NEQ to Comparison.EQ in the Select call for sel_new.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThat way, for each row i, it selects the j where target_pos[j] == i, and then Aggregate picks that value.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. make_hist seems correct. make_sort and make_sort_freq seem correct except for this issue in make_sort_unique.\n\nSo the main bug is in make_sort_unique, where the selector is using NEQ instead of EQ. Fixing that should solve the problem.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, when the keys are modified, the function is called with min_key=1. But in the function definition, the default for min_key is not specified. Wait, looking at the code, the make_sort function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. So both max_seq_len and min_key are required. But in make_sort_freq, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That's correct.\n\nSo the only issue is in make_sort_unique, where the selector is using NEQ instead of EQ.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 3507, "total_tokens": 8126}}, {"id": "gen-1738410916-xxbYB0aD4O6INAdFxCWC", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410916, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector incorrectly used `NEQ` instead of `EQ`.

It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos is not equal to indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but if target_pos is the count of smaller keys, then for each position, the target_pos would be the number of keys less than it. So when we select where target_pos != indices, that might not correctly pick the right position. Hmm, maybe the logic here is flawed. Let me think about how the aggregate works. The aggregate sums the selected vals weighted by the selector. But in this case, each row of sel_new would have only one True, right? Because each target_pos is unique since keys are unique. So for each row i, it selects the column where target_pos[i] == i. Wait, no, the selector is target_pos != indices. So for each row i, it's looking for columns j where target_pos[j] != i. That doesn't seem right. Maybe the selector should be where target_pos[j] == i, so that for each i, we select the j where target_pos[j] is i, meaning that j is the position where the key is the i-th smallest. So perhaps the selector should be rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ). That way, for each row i, it selects the j where target_pos[j] == i, which would be the position of the i-th smallest key. Then, when we aggregate, each position i would get the value from j where j is the i-th smallest. So the current code is using NEQ, which is incorrect. That's probably a bug.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ) should be EQ instead. Because we want to select the positions where target_pos equals the current index, which would correctly map each position to its sorted value.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). This function modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That seems correct because it ensures that keys are unique for sorting.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (hist) as the count of each token. Then it negates the hist so that when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency come first. It uses make_sort with tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len and min_key. Wait, but in the example, when hist is [2,1,2,1], negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted, the order would be based on these negative counts. However, the current code passes hist as the keys, but it's negated. So the keys are -hist. Then, when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent tokens (with higher hist) would come first because their negative is smaller. That makes sense. But let me check the parameters passed to make_sort. The function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but in the code, it's written as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). Wait, no, looking at the code, the make_sort_freq function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. Inside, it calls make_sort with vals=rasp.tokens, keys=hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1. So that's correct because the keys are the negated histogram.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So when the keys are negative, adding this term might not correctly order them. Hmm, perhaps that's okay because the min_key is positive, and the addition is small, ensuring that each key is unique. But I'm not sure if that's the issue.\n\nWait, looking back, the make_sort function is supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique. But in make_sort_freq, the keys are already unique because each token's frequency is used, and then modified by their position. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nBut let me think about the overall structure. The main issue I spotted was in make_sort_unique where the selector uses NEQ instead of EQ. That would cause the aggregate to not pick the correct values, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nSo to fix make_sort_unique, I need to change the selector comparison from NEQ to EQ.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, the line where sel_new is created should use EQ instead of NEQ.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all functions are using the correct parameters and that there are no other issues.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, which is correct for sorting in ascending order (since higher frequencies become more negative, so they come first when sorted). But when using make_sort, which sorts by < relation on keys, using negative hist would sort from lowest to highest, but since we want higher frequencies first, perhaps the sorting should be in descending order. Wait, no. Because make_sort sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if the keys are -hist, then higher hist (more frequent tokens) will have lower keys, so they will appear earlier in the sorted list. That's correct.\n\nWait, for example, if hist is [2,1,2,1], then keys after negation are [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1. So the tokens would be ordered as the first and third tokens first, then the second and fourth. But in the example given, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the more frequent tokens come first. So that's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother possible issue is in make_sort_freq. The function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but in the code, the parameters are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals, hist as keys, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key, it's x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. Since min_key is 1, and max_seq_len is given, this ensures that each key is unique. That should handle cases where the original keys have duplicates.\n\nSo the only bug is in make_sort_unique where the selector is using NEQ instead of EQ.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique function should have sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ).\n\nLet me write down the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2401, "total_tokens": 7020}}, {"id": "gen-1738411011-RWrgqRkC6C9WIMAdjgQ6", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411011, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector incorrectly used `NEQ` instead of `EQ`.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos is not equal to indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but the aggregate function in RASP is supposed to average the selected values. But in this case, we want to select exactly one value per position. So maybe this is correct because each row of sel_new should have exactly one True, so the aggregate would pick that value. But I'm not sure if the way sel_new is constructed is correct. Let me think: for each position i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than keys[i]. So for a sorted list, target_pos would be the correct position to place each element. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, but wait, the current code uses NEQ. Oh, that's a problem. Because if target_pos is the desired index, then we should select where target_pos equals the current index. So the selector should be EQ, not NEQ. Using NEQ would select all positions except the target, which is incorrect. So that's a bug. So in make_sort_unique, the line sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ) should be EQ instead.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term based on min_key, index, and max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. The lambda adds min_key * i / max_seq_len to x. This should make each key unique by adding a small value based on their position. That makes sense for numerical keys.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, hist is the count of each token. So when we sort by hist, we want tokens with higher frequency to come first. But in make_sort, the keys are being sorted in ascending order because it's using the 'smaller' comparison (LT). So when we negate hist, the most frequent tokens will have the smallest values, so they will be sorted first. Wait, no. Let me think: if hist is [2,1,2,1], negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to the original tokens [0,2,1,3]. So the sorted output would place the most frequent tokens first. But wait, in the example given, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1]. The hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted, the order is based on the keys, which are the negated hist. So the sorted indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the output is tokens[0], tokens[2], tokens[1], tokens[3], which is [2,2,4,1]. That's correct. So the function seems okay, but I should check if the way it's using make_sort is correct. The current code calls make_sort with vals as rasp.tokens and keys as hist. So it's sorting the tokens based on their frequency. But wait, the make_sort function is designed to sort vals based on the keys. So in this case, the keys are the negative histogram, which will sort the tokens in the order of their frequency, highest first. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the vals are the tokens, and the keys are the hist. So when sorted, each token is placed according to its key, which is the negative frequency. So tokens with higher frequency (more negative keys) come first. That's correct.\n\nBut going back to make_sort_unique, the bug is in the selector. So I need to fix that. So in make_sort_unique, the sel_new should be created with EQ, not NEQ.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique would have:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThat way, for each position i, it selects the row where target_pos equals i, which is the correct position to place the value.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, when it modifies the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so for the first element, i=0, it adds 0. For the second, i=1, adds min_key * 1 / max_seq_len, etc. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small increment based on their position. That should work as intended.\n\nWait, but in the example given for make_sort_freq, the output is [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the input is [2,4,2,1]. The hist is [2,1,2,1]. So negated hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted, the order is based on the keys, so the sorted indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the output is tokens[0], tokens[2], tokens[1], tokens[3], which is 2,2,4,1. Correct.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if the keys are not numerical? The function's note says it only works for numerical keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique where the selector uses NEQ instead of EQ. Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other issues.\n\nIn make_hist, the code is correct. It creates a selector where each element is compared to itself, which is always true, so the selector is all true. Then SelectorWidth gives the count of each token.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the selector in make_hist is created by comparing each token to every other token. So for each row i, it's true for all j where token[j] == token[i]. So the width is the number of times token[i] appears in the sequence. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort, the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function expects four arguments, but the example only passes four. Wait, no, the function is defined with four parameters, but in the code, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1). So that's correct.\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nSo the function expects vals, keys, max_seq_len, and min_key. So when called, all four must be provided. In the example, it's called correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example, it's called as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). Wait, no, looking at the code, the example shows:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(5)\n\nBecause the function only takes max_seq_len as an argument. So the example in the code is correct.\n\nWait, no, in the provided code, the function make_sort_freq is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the example usage, it's written as:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n\nWhich would be incorrect because the function only expects one argument. So that's a mistake. The example should be:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(5)\n\nBecause the function doesn't take vals or keys as arguments. So that's an error in the example, but the function itself is correct.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the code provided has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, no, the function make_sort_freq is defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter. But in the example, it's called with three arguments. That's a mistake. So the example is wrong, but the function is correct. So in the repaired code, I should correct the example.\n\nBut the user's task is to repair the RASP program, not the examples. So perhaps that's a separate issue, but the function itself is correct.\n\nSo to summarize, the main issue is in make_sort_unique where the selector uses NEQ instead of EQ. Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nSo the corrected code would change that line in make_sort_unique.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2997, "total_tokens": 7616}}, {"id": "gen-1738411128-JDzmfiFvDxlsgr1LhzkH", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411128, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the selector was incorrectly using the `NEQ` comparison.

So this should work, but maybe there's a better way to ensure it's selecting the correct position.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term that makes them unique. The term is min_key * i / max_seq_len, where i is the index. This ensures that when keys are the same, their indices make them unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That seems correct because it avoids tie-breaking issues.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as the key for sorting. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first. But when it calls make_sort(), it's passing hist as the keys, which is negated. Wait, in make_sort_freq(), the line is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut looking at make_sort's parameters, the second argument is keys. So in make_sort_freq, we're using hist as the keys. However, in make_sort, the function expects 'keys' to be numerical because it's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But hist is a sequence of counts, which are integers. So that should be fine.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the 'vals' are the tokens, and the 'keys' are the negated histogram. So when sorted, tokens are ordered by their frequency in ascending order because the keys are negated. But we want higher frequency tokens first, so maybe the sorting is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because in make_sort, the keys are being used to determine the order. So if the key is -hist, then when sorted in ascending order, higher hist (lower -hist) comes first. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort, the function sorts by the '<' relation on keys. So when the key is smaller, it comes earlier. So with negated hist, tokens with higher frequency (lower -hist) will be placed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nBut looking at the example in make_sort_freq's docstring:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) should return [2,2,4,1]\n\nThe histogram for [2,4,2,1] is [2,1,2,1]. So hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The keys for sorting are these negated values. So when sorted, the order is determined by these keys.\n\nWait, but how does make_sort handle this? Let me think.\n\nIn make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So each key becomes key + (min_key * index) / max_seq_len. Since min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is 5, each key is key + 0.2 * i.\n\nSo for the example, the original keys after negation are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. After modification, each becomes:\n\nFor index 0: -2 + 0*0.2 = -2\nIndex 1: -1 + 1*0.2 = -0.8\nIndex 2: -2 + 2*0.2 = -1.6\nIndex 3: -1 + 3*0.2 = -0.4\n\nSo the modified keys are [-2, -0.8, -1.6, -0.4].\n\nNow, when we sort based on these keys in ascending order, the order of indices would be sorted based on their modified keys.\n\nLet's list the modified keys with their indices:\n\nIndex 0: -2\nIndex 1: -0.8\nIndex 2: -1.6\nIndex 3: -0.4\n\nSorting these keys in ascending order:\n\n-2 (index 0), -1.6 (index 2), -0.8 (index1), -0.4 (index3)\n\nSo the sorted order of indices is 0, 2, 1, 3.\n\nSo the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, when it's called from make_sort_freq, the 'vals' are rasp.tokens, and 'keys' are the modified hist. So the function should correctly sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nBut looking at the code, in make_sort_freq, the function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but the parameters for make_sort are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in this case, vals is rasp.tokens, keys is hist. So when make_sort is called, it's using hist as the keys, which are the negated frequencies.\n\nBut in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So each key becomes key + (min_key * index) / max_seq_len. Since min_key is 1, and max_seq_len is provided, this should ensure that each key is unique, thus avoiding any tie issues.\n\nWait, but in the example, the keys after modification are unique, so the sorting should work correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is in how the selectors are being used. Let me check the make_sort_unique function again.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, 'smaller' is a selector where each row i has True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. Then target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which gives the number of elements smaller than key[i]. So target_pos[i] is the position where key[i] should be placed in the sorted array.\n\nThen sel_new is a selector where for each i, it's True if target_pos[i] equals the current index. So when we aggregate, each position i will pick the value from the original position where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nBut wait, in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], I think. So when we create sel_new as Select(target_pos, indices, NEQ), that would select positions where target_pos != index. Wait, no, the code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\nIn make_sort_unique, it's:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nWait, no, in the code, it's:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because target_pos is an SOp that gives the target position for each element. So for each i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be where target_pos[j] == i for each row i.\n\nBut the current code is using rasp.Select with target_pos as keys, rasp.indices as queries, and predicate NEQ. So for each i, it's checking if target_pos[j] != i. That would create a selector where each row i has True for all j where target_pos[j] != i. But that's the opposite of what we need.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because when we aggregate, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i, so that the value at j is placed at i. But the current selector is selecting where target_pos[j] != i, which would include all j except the correct one. So when we aggregate, it's taking the average of all j where target_pos[j] != i, which is incorrect.\n\nSo that's the bug. The selector in make_sort_unique is using NEQ instead of EQ. It should be EQ to select the correct positions.\n\nSo the corrected line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBecause for each row i, we want to select all j where target_pos[j] == i. Then, when we aggregate, each i will get the value from j where target_pos[j] == i, which is the correct position.\n\nSo that's the main issue. Let me check the other functions again.\n\nIn make_sort, the keys are being modified correctly to ensure uniqueness, so that function should be fine once make_sort_unique is fixed.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, the hist is correctly negated, so that should work once the sorting is fixed.\n\nSo the main repair is in make_sort_unique, changing the selector's predicate from NEQ to EQ.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other issues.\n\nIn make_hist(), it's correctly using SelectorWidth on the same_tok selector, which counts the number of equal tokens for each position.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding a term to make them unique, which is correct.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the approach is correct, assuming that the sorting functions are fixed.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique, correcting the selector predicate.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 3050, "total_tokens": 7669}}, {"id": "gen-1738411225-5Rl1uiEyr4S3b6UW6EZu", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411225, "choices": [{"error": {"message": "Exception: Chunk too big", "code": 502, "metadata": {"provider_name": "DeepInfra", "raw": {"error_type": "unknown_error", "error_message": "Exception: Chunk too big"}}}, "logprobs": null, "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos is not equal to indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position is the number of elements smaller than it. So for 2, there's 1 smaller (1), so target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The 'smaller' selector is keys compared with keys using LT. So for each i, j, it's True if keys[i] < keys[j]. The SelectorWidth of 'smaller' for each row i is the count of j where keys[i] < keys[j]. So target_pos[i] is the number of elements after i that are smaller than keys[i]. Wait, no, because for each row i, it's the count of j where keys[i] < keys[j]. So for the example [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector would be:\n\nRow 0 (2): j=1 (4>2), j=2 (3>2), j=3 (1<2 is false). So row 0 has two Trues. So target_pos[0] is 2.\n\nRow 1 (4): j=2 (3<4), j=3 (1<4). So two Trues. target_pos[1] is 2.\n\nRow 2 (3): j=3 (1<3). So one True. target_pos[2] is 1.\n\nRow 3 (1): no j where 1 < keys[j], so target_pos[3] is 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because in the example, the sorted output is [1,2,3,4], which would correspond to the original indices [3,0,2,1]. So the target_pos should be [3,0,2,1]. But according to the current code, target_pos is [2,2,1,0], which doesn't match. So the logic here is flawed.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The current code is counting how many elements are larger than the current key, not the number of elements smaller. So for each i, target_pos[i] is the count of j where keys[i] < keys[j]. But for sorting, we need the position where each element should be placed, which is the number of elements less than or equal to it before it. Hmm, maybe the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, the make_sort_unique function is supposed to return vals sorted by the keys. So for each position i in the output, we want the element from the input where its key is the i-th smallest. The way to do this is to compute for each element how many elements are smaller than it, which gives its position in the sorted list. So target_pos should be the count of keys less than the current key. But in the current code, 'smaller' is keys compared with keys using LT, so each row i counts how many keys[j] are less than keys[i]. So target_pos is the number of elements smaller than each key. That should give the correct positions.\n\nWait, let's test with the example [2,4,3,1]. The keys are [2,4,3,1]. For each i:\n\ni=0: keys[0]=2. How many keys[j] < 2? Only keys[3]=1. So target_pos[0] should be 1.\n\ni=1: keys[1]=4. No keys[j] <4 except 2,3,1. So target_pos[1] is 3.\n\ni=2: keys[2]=3. Keys less than 3 are 2 and 1. So target_pos[2] is 2.\n\ni=3: keys[3]=1. No keys less than 1. So target_pos[3] is 0.\n\nSo target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then, sel_new is a selector where target_pos is not equal to indices. So for each i, j, sel_new[i][j] is True if target_pos[i] != j. Wait, no. The selector is created with Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ). So for each i, it's checking if target_pos[i] != indices[j]. So for each row i, it selects all j where j is not equal to target_pos[i]. Then, when we aggregate vals using this selector, for each i, it sums all vals[j] where j is not equal to target_pos[i], but that doesn't make sense because we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, I think the logic is flawed. The current approach is trying to select for each i, the j where target_pos[j] == i. Because in the sorted list, position i should have the element whose target_pos is i. So the selector should be where target_pos[j] == i for each row i.\n\nSo the correct selector should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each row i (which is the target position), we want to select all j where target_pos[j] == i. Then, when we aggregate, each position i will get the value of j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nIn the current code, sel_new is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ), which is the opposite. So it's selecting all j where target_pos[i] != j, which is incorrect. Instead, it should be selecting j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo the fix is to change sel_new to Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each row i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] equals i.\n\nLet me adjust that. So in make_sort_unique, after computing target_pos, we create a selector where for each i, j is selected if target_pos[j] == i. So the selector is Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Then, when we aggregate vals with this selector, each position i will get the sum of vals[j] where target_pos[j] == i. But since all target_pos are unique (because keys are unique), it will pick exactly one j for each i, effectively sorting the vals based on the keys.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort_unique should be:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    # Create a selector where each row i selects j where target_pos[j] == i\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nWait, no. Because target_pos is an SOp, and rasp.Select expects two SOps as keys and queries. So in this case, for sel_new, we need to compare each index j's target_pos[j] with the current row i. So the correct way is to have keys as rasp.indices (each j) and queries as target_pos (each j's target_pos). So the selector is created as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). But wait, the Select function takes keys and queries as SOps. So in this case, keys would be rasp.indices, and queries would be target_pos. So for each j, we check if indices[j] equals target_pos[j]. No, that's not right. Because for each row i, we want to select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me think again. The selector is a matrix where row i and column j is True if the condition holds. So for sel_new, we want row i to select all j where target_pos[j] == i. So the condition is target_pos[j] == i. But in the Select function, for each j, we compare keys[j] (which would be rasp.indices[j] = j) with queries[j] (which would be target_pos[j]). So the condition is j == target_pos[j], which is not what we want. We need, for each row i, to check if target_pos[j] == i for each j.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to structure it differently. Maybe I should create a selector where for each row i, it's True for column j if target_pos[j] == i. So the keys would be target_pos, and the queries would be rasp.indices. Because for each j, target_pos[j] is compared to i (which is the row index). So the Select would be between target_pos and rasp.indices, using EQ. So the selector is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). But wait, the Select function's keys and queries are both SOps, so for each j, it's comparing target_pos[j] (keys) with rasp.indices[j] (queries). So row i would be True for j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, no. The Select function creates a selector where each element (i,j) is True if keys[i] predicate queries[j]. So if I have keys as target_pos and queries as rasp.indices, then for each i (row), j (column), it's True if target_pos[i] == rasp.indices[j]. So for row i, it's selecting all j where rasp.indices[j] == target_pos[i]. But rasp.indices[j] is j. So for row i, it's True for j where j == target_pos[i]. So the selector will have True only at column j = target_pos[i] for each row i. That's exactly what we need because for each i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. Wait, no. Because target_pos is a vector where target_pos[j] is the position that j should go to. So for each j, target_pos[j] is the i where j should be placed. So for row i, we want to select j where target_pos[j] == i. So the condition is target_pos[j] == i. But in the selector, for row i, the condition is keys[i] == queries[j]. So if keys is target_pos, then for row i, it's target_pos[i] == j. That's not what we want. We want for row i, to select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to have the keys as rasp.indices and the queries as target_pos. So for each j, we compare rasp.indices[j] (which is j) with target_pos[j]. So the condition is j == target_pos[j], which is not helpful. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should create a selector where for each j, we have a 1 in column j if target_pos[j] == i. So for each row i, the selector has a 1 in column j where target_pos[j] == i. To achieve this, the keys should be target_pos, and the queries should be rasp.indices. Because for each j, target_pos[j] is compared to i (the row index). So the selector is created as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). But wait, in the Select function, the keys are evaluated for each row i, and the queries for each column j. So for row i, column j, the condition is target_pos[i] == rasp.indices[j]. So for each row i, it's True where j equals target_pos[i]. So the selector will have True in column j = target_pos[i] for each row i. But that's the opposite of what we need. We need for row i, to select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, perhaps I should transpose the selector. Because the way Select works is that each row corresponds to the keys, and each column to the queries. So if I want for row i to select j where target_pos[j] == i, I need to have the keys as target_pos and the queries as rasp.indices. Because for each j, target_pos[j] is compared to i (the row index). So the condition is target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be constructed as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each row i (which is j in this case), it's comparing rasp.indices[i] (which is i) to target_pos[j]. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's say we have target_pos as a list [1,3,2,0] for the example [2,4,3,1]. So for each j, target_pos[j] is the position where j should be placed. So j=0 should go to position 1, j=1 to 3, j=2 to 2, j=3 to 0.\n\nWe need a selector where for each row i, the column j is True if target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=3 is True. For i=1, j=0 is True. For i=2, j=2 is True. For i=3, j=1 is True.\n\nSo the selector matrix would look like:\n\nRow 0: [False, False, False, True]\nRow 1: [True, False, False, False]\nRow 2: [False, False, True, False]\nRow 3: [False, True, False, False]\n\nTo create this, for each row i, we need to check if target_pos[j] == i for each j. So the condition is target_pos[j] == i. But in the Select function, each row i is comparing keys[i] to queries[j]. So to get target_pos[j] == i, we can set keys as target_pos and queries as rasp.indices. Because for each j, target_pos[j] is compared to i (the row index). So the selector is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). But wait, in the Select function, the keys are the first argument, and the queries are the second. So for each row i, it's keys[i] compared to queries[j]. So if keys is target_pos, then for row i, it's target_pos[i] compared to queries[j]. So for each j, the condition is target_pos[i] == queries[j]. But queries[j] is rasp.indices[j] which is j. So the condition is target_pos[i] == j. So for row i, the selector is True for j where j == target_pos[i]. That's the opposite of what we need.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to swap the keys and queries. So if I set keys as rasp.indices and queries as target_pos, then for each row i, it's comparing i to target_pos[j]. So the condition is i == target_pos[j], which is exactly what we need. So the selector should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each row i, it's checking if i equals target_pos[j] for each j. So the selector will have True in column j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in the code, sel_new should be created as:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThen, when we aggregate vals with this selector, each position i will get the value of j where target_pos[j] == i, which is the correct sorted order.\n\nSo the mistake in the original code was using Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ), which was incorrect. It should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\nNow, moving on to make_sort(). It takes vals, keys, max_seq_len, and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then calls make_sort_unique. This is to ensure that keys are unique for sorting when there are duplicates. But wait, in the example given, when keys are [2,4,2,1], the function returns [1,2,2,4], which is correct. So perhaps this part is okay.\n\nBut looking at make_sort_freq(), it uses make_hist() to compute the frequency, then multiplies by -1 to sort in ascending order of frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as the key. But wait, in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,1,1]. So negated hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, when sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist, so the smallest (most negative) comes first. So the sorted order would be [2,4,2,1] because the hist for 2 is 2, which is the highest frequency. So the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, the hist is an SOp that represents the frequency. So when we negate it, it becomes a numerical value. Then, when passed to make_sort, the keys are the negated hist. So the sorting is based on the negated frequency, which would sort from lowest to highest frequency. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the higher frequency comes first. So perhaps the negation is incorrect. Because higher frequency should come first, so we should sort in ascending order of the negated frequency. Wait, no. If we negate the frequency, higher frequency becomes more negative. So when sorted in ascending order, the more negative (higher frequency) comes first. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, the key is modified to ensure uniqueness. So when sorting, the original order is preserved for equal keys because the added term makes them unique. So the code should handle tie-breaking correctly.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in the function signature, the parameters are max_seq_len and min_key. So when calling make_sort in make_sort_freq, it's passing min_key=1. So the added term is 1 * i / max_seq_len. That should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the example for make_sort_freq, the input is [2,4,2,1], which has frequencies [2,1,1,1]. So the negated hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, when passed to make_sort, the keys are these negated values. So the sorting is based on these keys. The make_sort function then adds min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. So for each i, the key becomes (-2 + 1*0/5), (-1 +1*1/5), (-1 +1*2/5), (-1 +1*3/5). So the keys are [-2, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be [-2, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4], which corresponds to the original indices [0,1,2,3]. So the sorted output would be [2,4,2,1], which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct, except for the issue in make_sort_unique.\n\nSo to summarize, the main issue is in make_sort_unique where the selector is incorrectly created. The fix is to change sel_new to Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\nLet me apply this fix to the code.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_unique, the function is named \"sort\", but in the original code, it's named(\"sort\"). That's fine.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nWait, no. Because in the original code, the return is named(\"sort\"), but the function is make_sort_unique. So perhaps the name should be something else, but the name doesn't affect functionality.\n\nTesting this with the example [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. So sel_new is a selector where each row i selects j where j == target_pos[i]. So for row 0, j=1 is selected. For row 1, j=3 is selected. For row 2, j=2 is selected. For row 3, j=0 is selected. So when we aggregate vals, each position i gets vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. So the output would be [4,1,3,2], which is not correct. Wait, that can't be right. Because the original keys are [2,4,3,1], and the target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So the sorted order should be [1,2,3,4], which corresponds to the original indices [3,0,2,1]. So the target_pos should be [3,0,2,1], not [1,3,2,0]. So perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me re-calculate target_pos for [2,4,3,1].\n\nThe 'smaller' selector is created by comparing each key with all keys using LT. So for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than key[i].\n\nFor i=0, key=2: keys less than 2 are [1] \u2192 count=1 \u2192 target_pos[0]=1.\n\ni=1, key=4: keys less than 4 are [2,3,1] \u2192 count=3 \u2192 target_pos[1]=3.\n\ni=2, key=3: keys less than 3 are [2,1] \u2192 count=2 \u2192 target_pos[2]=2.\n\ni=3, key=1: no keys less than 1 \u2192 count=0 \u2192 target_pos[3]=0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0].\n\nNow, when we create sel_new as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ), for each row i, it selects j where j == target_pos[i]. So for row 0, j=1 is selected. For row 1, j=3 is selected. For row 2, j=2 is selected. For row 3, j=0 is selected.\n\nSo when we aggregate vals, each row i will take vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. So the output would be [vals[1], vals[3], vals[2], vals[0]] \u2192 [4,1,3,2]. But the desired output is [1,2,3,4]. So this approach isn't working as expected.\n\nWait, that's not correct. So perhaps the way target_pos is calculated is wrong. Because the target_pos should represent the position where each element should be placed in the sorted array. So for the example, the sorted order is [1,2,3,4], which corresponds to the original indices [3,0,2,1]. So target_pos should be [3,0,2,1].\n\nBut according to the current code, target_pos is [1,3,2,0], which is not matching. So the approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way target_pos is calculated is incorrect. Instead of counting the number of elements less than the current key, we should count the number of elements less than or equal to the current key, but that might not solve it either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach should be to compute for each key the number of elements less than or equal to it, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the 'smaller' selector is using LT, but we should be using LEQ. Let me try that.\n\nIf I change the predicate to LEQ, then for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of elements less than or equal to key[i]. So for the example [2,4,3,1]:\n\ni=0, key=2: elements <=2 are [2,1] \u2192 count=2 \u2192 target_pos[0]=2.\n\ni=1, key=4: all elements are <=4 \u2192 count=4 \u2192 target_pos[1]=4. But max_seq_len is 4, so perhaps it's 3 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nWait, no. The count is the number of elements less than or equal to key[i]. So for key=4, all 4 elements are <=4, so target_pos[1]=4. But in a zero-based index, the maximum position is 3. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and we need a different way to compute the target positions.\n\nAnother idea: the target_pos should be such that when sorted, each element is placed at the position equal to the number of elements less than it. So for the example [2,4,3,1], the sorted order is [1,2,3,4]. The number of elements less than 1 is 0, so it goes to position 0. For 2, number of elements less than 2 is 1 (only 1), so it goes to position 1. For 3, number of elements less than 3 is 2 (1 and 2), so position 2. For 4, number of elements less than 4 is 3, so position 3. So target_pos should be [1,3,2,0], which is what the current code computes. So the target_pos is correct.\n\nBut then, when creating the selector, we need to map each element to its target position. So for each j, the element at j should go to target_pos[j]. So in the selector, for each row i, we need to select j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be True at (i,j) if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo to create this selector, we can use Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each row i, it's checking if i equals target_pos[j] for each j.\n\nWait, no. Because in the Select function, each row corresponds to the keys, and each column to the queries.

Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with EQ comparison to create a selector and then applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct. So, no issues here.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then, `target_pos` is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. The selector `sel_new` is where target_pos is not equal to indices, which might be trying to find the correct position to place each element. Then it aggregates vals using this selector. Wait, but if the keys are unique, this should work. However, I'm not sure if the logic correctly sorts the values. Maybe the way `sel_new` is constructed is incorrect. Let me think: for each position i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than key[i]. So, the correct position for key[i] should be target_pos[i]. So, the selector should select the position where index equals target_pos[i]. But in the current code, `sel_new` is `Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ)`, which might not be the right approach. Instead, perhaps we should create a selector where for each i, j is selected if j == target_pos[i]. So, maybe using `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ)` or something similar. Hmm, perhaps the current selector is incorrect, leading to wrong aggregation.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. Then calls `make_sort_unique`. That seems okay, but I should check if the key modification is correctly done. The lambda adds min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Since i is the index, this should make each key unique by adding a small value based on their position. That makes sense.\n\nNow, `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram, negates it to sort in ascending order of frequency, and then sorts. Wait, but when you negate the histogram, higher frequencies become more negative, so sorting in ascending order would place higher frequencies first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorting is by frequency descending. But in the code, `hist` is negated, so when passed to `make_sort`, which sorts by keys in ascending order, it would arrange from lowest to highest, but since hist is negated, higher frequencies come first. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but looking at `make_sort`, it's called with `hist` as the keys. So the keys are the negative histogram values. So when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent elements (with more negative keys) come first. That should be correct.\n\nBut let me check the `make_sort_unique` function again. The way `sel_new` is constructed might be incorrect. Let's say for each element, we want to find its correct position in the sorted array. `target_pos` is the number of elements smaller than the current key. So for each i, the correct position is target_pos[i]. So, to create a selector that selects the correct positions, we need for each i, a selector where j is selected if j == target_pos[i]. \n\nIn the current code, `sel_new` is `rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)`. That would create a selector where each row i has True for all j not equal to target_pos[i]. But when we aggregate, we're taking the sum of vals where the selector is True, but since each row has only one True (where j == target_pos[i]), the aggregation would pick the value at that position. Wait, no. Because the selector is NEQ, it's True where j != target_pos[i]. So when we aggregate, it's summing all vals except the one at target_pos[i], which doesn't make sense. That's probably the bug.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to create a selector where each row i has True only at j = target_pos[i]. So, the selector should be created using EQ, not NEQ. So, `sel_new` should be `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` or similar. Let me think about the parameters of `rasp.Select`. The function is `Select(keys, queries, predicate)`. So, to check if indices equals target_pos, we can set keys as rasp.indices and queries as target_pos, with predicate EQ.\n\nSo, the corrected `sel_new` should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBut wait, in the current code, it's `rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ)`. That's incorrect because it's checking if target_pos[i] != indices[j], which would select all j where j is not the target position for i. So when aggregating, it's summing all vals except the one at the target position, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nSo, the fix is to change the selector to select where indices equals target_pos. So, the corrected code for `make_sort_unique` would be:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    # Create a selector where each row i selects the column j where j == target_pos[i]\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's `rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, NEQ)`. So, the keys are target_pos, queries are indices, and predicate is NEQ. So, for each i, it's checking if target_pos[i] != indices[j]. So, the selector has True where j != target_pos[i]. So, when we aggregate, it's summing all vals except the one at j = target_pos[i], but since the default is None, it's not including that. So, the result would be incorrect.\n\nSo, the fix is to create a selector where each row i has True only at j = target_pos[i]. So, the correct selector is created by checking if indices[j] equals target_pos[i]. So, the keys should be rasp.indices, and the queries should be target_pos. So, the Select call should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nAlternatively, since the order of keys and queries in Select is such that for each i, it's checking keys[i] op queries[j]. So, to get for each i, j where j == target_pos[i], we can set keys as target_pos and queries as rasp.indices, and predicate EQ. Because for each i, we want j where target_pos[i] == indices[j]. So, another way is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWait, let me think. The Select function creates a matrix where element (i,j) is True if keys[i] predicate queries[j]. So, if keys is target_pos, and queries is indices, then for each i, j, it's True if target_pos[i] == indices[j]. So, for row i, the True is at column j where j is target_pos[i]. So, that's exactly what we need.\n\nSo, the correct selector is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nSo, in the original code, it was using NEQ, which was incorrect. So, replacing NEQ with EQ and adjusting the keys and queries accordingly should fix the issue.\n\nSo, the corrected `make_sort_unique` function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"sel_new\")\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the selector was named \"sel_new\", but the parameters were incorrect. So, with this fix, the aggregation should correctly pick the vals at the target positions, thus sorting them.\n\nAnother thing to check is in `make_sort_freq`. The hist is negated, so when passed to `make_sort`, which sorts in ascending order, the most frequent elements come first. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the main issue is in `make_sort_unique`, where the selector was incorrectly using NEQ instead of EQ, and the keys and queries were in the wrong order.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any possible issues.\n\nIn `make_sort`, the keys are modified by adding a term based on index to ensure uniqueness. That seems correct.\n\nIn `make_hist`, everything looks fine.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in `make_sort_unique`, correcting the selector.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with this fix.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2800, "total_tokens": 7419}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
