Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position in the sorted order is its index. So sel_new would select the correct positions. Then Aggregate should pick the correct vals. Hmm, maybe this works, but I'm not sure. Let me think about how Aggregate works. It applies the selector to pick elements from sop (here, vals) and averages them, but since each row of the selector has only one True, it's effectively selecting that element. So this should correctly sort the vals based on the keys. So maybe this function is okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. The idea is to ensure that when there are duplicate keys, their positions break the tie. The function then calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. Let's see: keys are updated by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x at position i, it becomes x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This should make each key unique because even if two x's are the same, their positions differ, so the added term makes them different. Then sorting on these unique keys should work. But wait, in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become [2 + 1*0/5, 4 +1*1/5, 3 +1*2/5, 1 +1*3/5] which is [2, 4.2, 3.4, 1.6]. Sorting these would order them as 1.6 (position 3), 2 (position 0), 3.4 (position 2), 4.2 (position 1), so the sorted order is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. So this function seems okay.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the function definition, the first line is keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...). So it's reassigning the keys parameter. That's fine because it's creating new keys.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort_freq(). The function is supposed to sort tokens based on their frequency. It first computes hist as -0 * make_hist(). Wait, that's a problem. make_hist() returns the count of each token. So hist is a sequence where each element is the count of that token. But then it's multiplied by -0, which is 0. So hist becomes all zeros. That's definitely wrong. The intention was probably to create a histogram and then use it as the key for sorting, but the current code is incorrect.\n\nSo the issue is in make_sort_freq(). The line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") is wrong. Instead, it should compute the histogram correctly. Let me think: make_hist() returns an SOp that, when evaluated, gives the count of each token. So to use it as keys for sorting, we need to pass it correctly. But in the current code, it's being multiplied by zero, which zeros it out. So that's a bug.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the histogram and then use it as the key in make_sort. So instead of hist = -0 * make_hist(), it should just be hist = make_hist(). But wait, in the example, the function is called as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len), which is then used to sort the tokens based on their frequency. So the keys for sorting should be the histogram counts.\n\nWait, but in the current code, it's doing hist = -0 * make_hist(), which is zero. So when passed to make_sort, the keys are all zero, which would not sort correctly. So that's the main issue.\n\nSo to fix make_sort_freq(), I need to correctly compute the histogram. Let me rewrite that part.\n\nInstead of hist = -0 * make_hist(), it should be hist = make_hist(). But wait, looking at the example, when the input is [2,4,2,1], the histogram is [2,1,2,1]. So the keys for sorting would be [2,1,2,1]. But when sorting, lower frequency comes first. So to sort in ascending order of frequency, we need to use these keys. However, in the current code, the keys are being negated, which would sort in descending order. But the example shows that the output is [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). Wait, no: in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is the input sorted by frequency, with 2 appearing first because it's more frequent. So to achieve that, the sort should be in ascending order of frequency? Or wait, no: higher frequency should come first. So the keys should be the histogram, and we sort in ascending order, but wait, no. Let me think: the example input is [2,4,2,1]. The histogram is [2,1,2,1]. So the keys are [2,1,2,1]. So when sorted by keys in ascending order, the order would be 1 (position 1), 1 (position 3), 2 (position 0), 2 (position 2). So the sorted output would be [4,1,2,2], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that's different. So perhaps the sorting is done in descending order of frequency. So the keys should be negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first.\n\nWait, the make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if we want to sort tokens by frequency in descending order, we need to make the keys such that higher frequencies have lower values. So negating the histogram would achieve that. Because, for example, a frequency of 2 becomes -2, which is less than a frequency of 1 (-1). So when sorted in ascending order, -2 comes before -1, so the higher frequency tokens come first.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the histogram and then negate it to use as keys for sorting. So the line should be hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). But in the current code, it's multiplied by -0, which is zero. So that's the bug.\n\nSo the fix is to change hist = -0 * make_hist() to hist = -1 * make_hist().\n\nWait, but in RASP, how do we multiply by -1? Because the current code uses rasp.Map to apply a function. So to negate the histogram, we can use rasp.Map with a lambda function.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort_freq() should compute the histogram, then create a new SOp that is the negative of the histogram. Then pass that as the keys to make_sort.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the histogram using make_hist().\n2. Negate each element of the histogram using rasp.Map.\n3. Use this negated histogram as the keys in make_sort.\n\nSo in code:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nAlternatively, combining the steps:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()), max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the line was hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is incorrect. So replacing that with the correct negation.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nAlternatively, in a more concise way:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist()\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the function was called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but hist was zero. So the fix is to correctly compute the negated histogram.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main issue is in make_sort_freq where the histogram is incorrectly computed as zero. The fix is to compute the histogram and negate it.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So when the keys are negative (because we negated the histogram), adding this term would still keep them unique as long as the min_key is positive and max_seq_len is sufficiently large.\n\nSo the final step is to correct the make_sort_freq function by properly negating the histogram instead of zeroing it.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4620, "completion_tokens": 3044, "total_tokens": 7664}}, {"id": "gen-1738410434-2XH6UADMmTXvNo7Fc39s", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410434, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_freq()` function where the histogram was incorrectly calculated.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then gets the width. That seems correct. The example shows it returns the count of each token, so I think this function is fine.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by comparing keys with LT. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller'. The selector 'sel_new' is where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4]. Let me think about how this works.\n\nThe 'smaller' selector for each position i will have True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. The width of this is the number of elements smaller than key[i], which gives the target position. So when we aggregate, each position i will pick the value from position target_pos[i], which should be the sorted order. That makes sense. So this function seems correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature is correct. The modification to keys seems right to ensure uniqueness for sorting.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It calculates hist as -0 * make_hist(). Wait, that's probably a typo. It should be hist = make_hist(), but the negative sign is incorrect. Oh, I see, the line is hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). That doesn't make sense. Maybe it was meant to multiply by -1? Or perhaps it's a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, the comment says hist is the number of times each token occurs. So in make_sort_freq(), hist is used as the key for sorting. But the code does hist = -0 * make_hist(). That would zero out the histogram, which is wrong. Oh, I see, the correct approach is to compute the histogram and then use it as the key, but perhaps the sign was intended to sort in ascending order. But multiplying by -0 is the same as zero, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the line should probably be hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\") and then use it as the key. Alternatively, if the intention was to sort in ascending order of frequency, perhaps the keys should be negated. But in the current code, it's multiplied by -0, which is zero, making all hist values zero. That's definitely a bug.\n\nSo the fix is to correct that line. Instead of -0 * make_hist(), it should be -1 * make_hist() or just use the hist as is, depending on the desired sorting order. Since in the example, the tokens are sorted by frequency, with higher frequency coming first. So the keys for sorting should be the negative of the histogram so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the keys are used to determine the order. If we want to sort by frequency in descending order, the keys should be such that lower values come first. So using negative histogram would achieve that because when sorted in ascending order, the more frequent tokens (with higher negative values) would come first.\n\nSo the correct line should be hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). But in the current code, it's -0, which is wrong. So that's the bug to fix.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But the make_sort function expects 'keys' as the second argument. So using hist as keys is correct because we're sorting based on frequency.\n\nSo the main issue is the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). It should be hist = (-1) * make_hist().named(\"hist\").\n\nWait, but how do you multiply a SOp by a scalar in RASP? Because make_hist() returns a SOp, and multiplying by a scalar isn't directly supported. Oh, right, in RASP, to multiply each element by a scalar, you can use rasp.Map. So the correct way is to apply a Map that multiplies each element by -1.\n\nSo the line should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\").\n\nAlternatively, using a more efficient approach, perhaps using SequenceMap if needed, but Map should suffice here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_sort_freq() function should compute the histogram, negate it using Map, and then pass it to make_sort.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in RASP, the indices start from 0, so for a sequence of length n, the indices are 0 to n-1. Dividing by max_seq_len scales it, but if the sequence is shorter than max_seq_len, it's fine. However, if the sequence is longer, the indices would go beyond max_seq_len, making the addition larger. But since max_seq_len is provided as a parameter, it's up to the user to ensure it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the function signature of make_sort(), the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So the function expects these to be passed correctly.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort_freq(), correcting the histogram calculation.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") is incorrect. It should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\").\n\n2.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each key, how many are smaller. So when we select where target_pos equals indices, that would pick the correct positions. But I'm not sure if the Aggregate is correctly picking the right values. Maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature seems correct.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It computes hist as -0 * make_hist(). Wait, that's just zeroing the histogram. Because multiplying by -0 is 0. So hist is all zeros. Then it uses make_sort with tokens and hist as keys. But that doesn't make sense because the keys are zero, so all elements would have the same key, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nOh, right! The intention of make_sort_freq is to sort tokens by their frequency. So higher frequency comes first. But the current code is setting hist to zero, which is wrong. Instead, it should compute the histogram correctly and then sort based on that.\n\nWait, the line is hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). That's equivalent to hist = 0 * make_hist(), which is zero. That's definitely a bug. It should just be hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\") so that we get the actual frequencies.\n\nSo the mistake is in the make_sort_freq function where hist is incorrectly calculated. Instead of negating or zeroing, it should just use the histogram as is. Then, when passed to make_sort, it sorts based on the frequency.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which should correctly sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nSo the fix is to change hist = -0 * make_hist() to hist = make_hist(). That way, the histogram is correctly computed, and the sorting works as intended.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. make_sort_unique and make_sort seem okay.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position, which gives the position each key should move to in a sorted list. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals using this selector. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position correctly. But when there are duplicate keys, this might cause issues because target_pos could have the same value for different keys, leading to incorrect aggregation. However, the function is supposed to handle only unique keys, so maybe that's acceptable.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That makes sense because the sorting will be stable for original key duplicates. But wait, in the example where keys are [2,4,1,2], the modified keys would be 2 + 1*0/5=2, 4 +1*1/5=4.2, 1 +1*2/5=1.4, 2 +1*3/5=2.6. So when sorted, the order would be 1.4, 2, 2.6, 4.2, which corresponds to the original indices 2,0,3,1. So the sorted vals would be [1,2,2,4], which is correct. So this function seems okay.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It first computes the histogram, then negates it by multiplying with -0. Wait, that's a problem. In Python, -0 is just 0, so hist = -0 * make_hist() would set hist to zero. That's not right. Oh, I see, the intention was to negate the histogram so that when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency come first. But the way it's written, it's multiplying by zero, which gives zero. So that's a bug. Instead, it should be hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") or just rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).\n\nSo the error is in the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). This should be changed to multiply by -1 instead of 0.\n\nLet me check the rest of make_sort_freq(). It then calls make_sort with vals as tokens and keys as hist. But wait, the parameters for make_sort are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). In the current code, make_sort_freq() is calling make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That seems correct because it's using the tokens as vals and hist as keys. So the sorted tokens will be ordered by their frequency.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_freq() where the histogram is being multiplied by zero instead of negated. Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified with min_key * i / max_seq_len. Is this the correct way to ensure uniqueness? Yes, because adding a small value based on position breaks ties. But perhaps using a different scaling factor might be better, but the current approach should work.\n\nSo the plan is to correct the make_sort_freq() function by changing the multiplication factor from 0 to -1.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4620, "completion_tokens": 1665, "total_tokens": 6285}}, {"id": "gen-1738410673-MuN8h1Sa8MVtfny29z1g", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410673, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_freq` function where the histogram was incorrectly computed.

Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but the aggregate function here might not be correct. Because if each row of sel_new has exactly one True, then aggregate will pick that value. But if there are multiple, it would average, which isn't desired. However, since the function is for unique keys, each target_pos should be unique, so each row should have one True. So this should work. Maybe no issue here.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. I don't see an obvious problem here.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It computes hist as -0 * make_hist(). Wait, that's zero multiplied by hist, which would make all counts zero. Then it uses this as the key for sorting. That doesn't make sense because all keys would be zero, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nOh, I see. The intention was probably to compute the negative histogram so that higher frequencies come first when sorted in ascending order. But the way it's written is incorrect. Instead of -0 * hist, which is zero, it should be -1 * hist. So hist = make_hist(), then neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist). Then use neg_hist as the key.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -0 * make_hist() is wrong. It should be hist = make_hist(), then create neg_hist by mapping lambda x: -x over hist. Then pass neg_hist to make_sort.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() should compute the histogram, negate it, and then sort based on that.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the histogram using make_hist().\n2. Create a new SOp by negating each element of the histogram.\n3. Use this negated histogram as the key in make_sort().\n\nSo the corrected code would replace the line hist = -0 * make_hist() with hist = make_hist(), then create neg_hist using rasp.Map.\n\nWait, but looking at the original code, the line is hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). That's equivalent to zero, which is wrong. So I need to fix that part.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq() should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nThis way, the histogram is computed, then each value is negated, so when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency come first.\n\nI think that's the main issue. Let me check if there are other problems. For example, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. That should ensure that each key is unique, allowing the sort to work correctly even if there are ties.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq(), the min_key is set to 1. Since the keys are negated frequencies, which could be negative, adding a positive min_key might not be necessary.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each index exactly once, and aggregate should pick the correct value. Hmm, maybe this is correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become unique. That makes sense. But I'm not sure if the way keys are modified is correct. Also, the function parameters: the original code has 'keys: rasp.SOp' but in the function definition, it's written as 'keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float'. That might cause issues because the function expects 'keys' as the second positional argument, but in the call, it's passed as a keyword. Wait, no, in the function definition, after '*', all parameters are keyword-only. So when calling make_sort, the user must provide max_seq_len and min_key as keywords. But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which would fail because 5 and 1 are positional, not keyword. So that's a problem. The function signature should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only, but the example calls them positionally. So the function definition is incorrect. It should have the parameters after * as keyword-only, but the example is using positional. So I need to fix the function signature to accept them as keyword arguments. Alternatively, perhaps the parameters should be positional or have default values.\n\nWait, looking at the function definition:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nThis means that max_seq_len and min_key must be passed as keyword arguments. But in the example, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which passes them positionally. That would cause a TypeError because the function expects 2 positional arguments but got 4. So this is a bug. To fix it, the function should either have default values for max_seq_len and min_key, making them optional, or the example should pass them as keywords. But since the function is supposed to require these parameters, perhaps the function should not have the * and allow positional. Alternatively, the example is incorrect. But the user probably intended to have max_seq_len and min_key as required parameters, so the function signature is correct, but the example is wrong. However, in the code, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which is incorrect. So to fix this, the function should accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments. So I should remove the * in the function definition.\n\nWait, no. The * in the function parameters forces the following parameters to be keyword-only. So the correct way is to call the function with keyword arguments. So in the example, it should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1). But the current example in the code is incorrect. So I need to fix the function's example usage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should have default values for max_seq_len and min_key. But the problem statement says that in make_sort_freq, max_seq_len is passed as a positional argument. Wait, looking at make_sort_freq:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nHere, make_sort is called with max_seq_len and min_key as keywords. So that's correct. But in the example usage of make_sort, it's called with positional arguments. So the function's example is wrong. Therefore, in the function make_sort, the example should be corrected to use keyword arguments.\n\nBut the user's task is to repair the RASP program, so perhaps the function signature is correct, but the example is wrong. However, the function's parameters are defined correctly, so perhaps the issue is elsewhere.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But rasp.indices starts at 0. So for each position i, the key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique because each i is unique. But is this the correct approach? It seems so, as it adds a small value to each key based on their position, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, then negates it by multiplying with -0. Wait, that's a problem. Because in RASP, multiplying by a scalar might not be straightforward. The code does hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). But in RASP, to negate each element, you should use rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist). Because simply multiplying by -0 (which is 0) would set everything to 0, which is not the intended behavior. Oh wait, no, the code says -0 * hist. But 0 * hist is zero, so hist becomes zero. That's definitely a bug. The intention was to negate the histogram, so that when sorting, higher frequencies come first. So instead of -0 * hist, it should be rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist). So that's a clear error.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\") is incorrect. It should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\")).named(\"hist\"). Because -0 is 0, multiplying by it would zero out the histogram, which is not the intended behavior.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_unique(), the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). But the Aggregate function's default is None, which is correct. However, in cases where multiple elements could be selected, but the code is supposed to handle unique keys, perhaps it's okay. But the function is intended for unique keys, so each row of the selector should have exactly one True, making Aggregate pick that single value.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the histogram is incorrectly negated using multiplication by -0, which zeros it out. It should use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that negates each element.\n\n2. The example usage in make_sort() is incorrect because it passes max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments instead of keyword arguments. However, the function signature is correct, so the example should be fixed, but since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function's parameters should be adjusted to accept positional arguments. Alternatively, the example should be corrected, but that's outside the code.\n\nWait, but the function's parameters are defined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nWhich means that max_seq_len and min_key must be passed as keyword arguments. So in the example, the usage should be:\n\nsort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1)\n\nBut in the provided code, the example shows:\n\nsort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n\nWhich is incorrect. So the function's example is wrong. However, the task is to repair the RASP program, so perhaps the function's parameters should be adjusted to not use the * and allow positional arguments. Alternatively, the example should be corrected. But since the function is part of the code, perhaps the function's signature is incorrect and should not have the *, making max_seq_len and min_key positional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should have default values for max_seq_len and min_key, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. So perhaps the function's signature is correct, and the example is wrong. But since the task is to repair the program, I'll focus on the code.\n\nSo, to fix the code:\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), replace the line:\n\nhist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nwith:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\")).named(\"hist\")\n\nThat should correctly negate each element of the histogram.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, the code uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But rasp.indices starts at 0, so for the first element, i=0, which adds 0. That's correct. But what if max_seq_len is larger than the actual sequence length? It shouldn't matter because the addition is proportional.\n\nWait, but in RASP, the operations are based on the input sequence's length. So when using rasp.indices, it's 0-based and goes up to len(input)-1. So the code should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys). But keys have been modified, so that should be correct.\n\nSo, the main repair is in make_sort_freq() where the histogram is incorrectly negated.\n\nAdditionally, in the function make_sort(), the example usage is incorrect, but that's a documentation issue, not a code issue. So perhaps the code is correct, but the example is wrong. However, since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function's parameters should be adjusted to accept positional arguments. Alternatively, the function's example should be corrected, but that's outside the code.\n\nWait, looking back, the function make_sort() is called in make_sort_freq() correctly with keyword arguments. So the function's signature is correct. The example in the code is wrong, but that's a separate issue.\n\nSo, to summarize, the main issue is in make_sort_freq() where the histogram is being multiplied by -0, which is incorrect. It should be replaced with a Map that applies a negation.\n\nSo, the corrected code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is incorrect. So replacing that with the Map.\n\nSo, the final code will have that line corrected.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4620, "completion_tokens": 3223, "total_tokens": 7843}}, {"id": "gen-1738410863-OhlbcNKouzwb8KscFXXL", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410863, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_freq` function where the histogram was incorrectly computed.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but the aggregate function here might not be correctly aligning the values. Because target_pos is a sequence where each element is the count of smaller keys, and sel_new is trying to find the position where this count matches the index. But when there are duplicate keys, this might not work correctly. However, the function is intended for unique keys, so maybe it's okay.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term based on min_key, index, and max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique. The issue might be with how the keys are being modified. Let me check the lambda: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. If i ranges from 0 to max_seq_len-1, then for each position, a small value is added. This should make keys unique as long as min_key is sufficiently large relative to the key differences. But perhaps the way it's being used in make_sort_unique is correct.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, then negates it (hist = -0 * make_hist()...). Wait, that line doesn't look right. The code is written as hist = - 0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). That would compute 0 multiplied by the histogram, which is just zero. Then negated, still zero. So hist is a sequence of zeros. That's definitely wrong. The intention was probably to compute the negative of the histogram so that when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent comes first. So the correct line should be hist = -make_hist().named(\"hist\") or something similar.\n\nSo the error is in the line hist = - 0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). It should be hist = -make_hist().named(\"hist\"). The current code multiplies the histogram by zero, resulting in all zeros, which would cause the sorting to not work as intended.\n\nLet me correct that line. Instead of -0 * hist, it should be -hist. So the corrected code would be:\n\nhist = -make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nThat way, the histogram is negated, and when used as keys in make_sort, the sorting will arrange tokens from most frequent to least.\n\nI should also check if other parts are correct. For example, in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort uses rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. Wait, no, the keys are hist, which is the negated histogram. So the function is correctly passing vals as tokens and keys as hist.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. So when there are ties in the original keys, this modification breaks them, allowing the sort to order them correctly.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_freq where the histogram is incorrectly computed.

Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. The selector sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Then it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each index exactly once. So the aggregate should pick the correct vals. Hmm, maybe this is correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the example given in make_sort_freq uses make_sort with three arguments, but the function definition here requires four (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). Oh, wait, in make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct. So maybe no issue here.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It computes hist as negative of make_hist(). Then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, hist is the count of each token. So when sorted by hist, it should arrange tokens by their frequency. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] has hist [2,1,2,1]. So hist is [2,1,2,1]. When negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So the keys for sorting are these negative counts. So when sorted in ascending order (since the sort is based on < relation), the tokens with lower negative counts (i.e., higher frequency) come first. So in the example, the sorted order would be 2,2,4,1, which matches the expected output.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the line is hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). That seems odd. -0 is just 0, so multiplying by 0 would make hist all zeros. That's definitely a bug. Oh, I see, the user probably meant to write hist = -1 * make_hist(), but the code has -0. So that's incorrect. Because -0 is 0, so hist becomes zero for all elements. That would break the sorting.\n\nSo the problem is in make_sort_freq(). The line should be hist = -1 * make_hist(), not -0. Because -0 is 0, which when used as keys would make all keys zero, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nSo to fix it, I need to change that line. Let me check the original code again. Yes, the line is hist = - 0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). So that's definitely wrong. It should be -1 multiplied.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if the keys are not unique, adding this would make them unique. That part seems correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_freq() where the hist is incorrectly calculated as zero. So the fix is to change -0 to -1.\n\nLet me also check if other parts are correct. For example, in make_sort_unique(), the Aggregate is used correctly. The selector sel_new is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices, which should give a single True per row, so Aggregate is appropriate.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are adjusted correctly to ensure uniqueness, which allows make_sort_unique to work even with non-unique keys.\n\nSo the only bug is in make_sort_freq() where the hist is multiplied by zero. Changing that to -1 should fix it.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4620, "completion_tokens": 1659, "total_tokens": 6279}}, {"id": "gen-1738410953-rN3wp9GOIhqKL68Lyw60", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410953, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we need to fix the incorrect negation of the histogram in the `make_sort_freq` function.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but the example shows that it sorts the values. So for keys [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], and sel_new would select each position's index. So when aggregating, each position picks the value from vals where the index matches target_pos. That should arrange the values in order. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the logic is correct. Let me think: for each row in 'smaller', the number of Trues is the count of elements less than the current key. So target_pos is the rank. Then sel_new selects the position where the index is equal to target_pos, which would pick the correct value. So this seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. This ensures that each key is unique, so sorting works correctly. The example given seems to handle duplicates by adding small increments. I think this part is correct.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). Let's look at it. It computes the histogram, then negates it by multiplying with -0. Wait, that's a bit odd. Oh, wait, in Python, -0 is just 0, so that line is equivalent to hist = 0 * make_hist(), which would set hist to zero. That can't be right. Oh, I see, the user probably intended to compute the negative of the histogram. But the way it's written is incorrect. Instead of -0 * hist, it should be something like rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist). Because multiplying by -0 gives zero, not the negative.\n\nSo the error is in the line hist = -0 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). This would result in hist being zero everywhere, which is wrong. Instead, we need to create a new SOp that represents the negative of the histogram.\n\nSo to fix this, I should replace that line with a proper Map operation. For example, hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\")). That way, each element is negated.\n\nLet me check the rest of make_sort_freq(). It then calls make_sort with rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len. So after fixing the hist computation, this should correctly sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_freq(), where the histogram is incorrectly negated. The fix is to use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that multiplies by -1.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4620, "completion_tokens": 1564, "total_tokens": 6184}}, {"id": "gen-1738410997-p7DG0XZtbSEeayolPHTV", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410997, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified an issue in the `make_sort_freq` function where the histogram was incorrectly computed.

So in the example, [2,4,2,1] has frequencies [2,1,2,1]. The negative would be [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these keys. So the tokens with -2 would come before those with -1. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo the mistake was in how the negative was applied.

RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
