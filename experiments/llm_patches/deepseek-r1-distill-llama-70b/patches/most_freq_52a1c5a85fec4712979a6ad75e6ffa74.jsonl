Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals with this selector. Wait, but the aggregate will pick the value where the selector is true. So for each position, it's selecting the value from vals where target_pos equals the current index. That should arrange the values in order. But I'm not sure if this correctly handles all cases, especially when there are duplicates. But the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * index, shifted by max_seq_len. Then calls make_sort_unique. The lambda in SequenceMap is x + (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len. Wait, in Python, >> is bitwise shift. Oh, that's a problem. It should probably be division, not a bitwise operation. So instead of shifting, it's adding min_key multiplied by the index, then dividing by max_seq_len. Or maybe the intention was to scale the index so that each key is unique. But using bitwise shift here is incorrect. For example, if i is 1, 1 >> max_seq_len would be 0 for max_seq_len >1. That's not right. So this line is buggy.\n\nSo the correct approach would be to adjust the keys by adding a small value based on their position to ensure uniqueness. So instead of using >>, we should use division or just addition. Wait, the original intention was to add min_key * i, but then scale it somehow. Maybe the code should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, but that would require using a float. Alternatively, perhaps it's x + min_key * i, without any division or shifting. Because if min_key is 1 and i ranges up to max_seq_len-1, then each key is increased by a unique amount, ensuring that all keys become unique.\n\nSo the line should be changed from using >> to just addition. So the correct code would be x + min_key * i. But wait, in the original code, it's x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. That's a mistake because >> has higher precedence than +, so it's (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len, which is zero for i < max_seq_len. So that's definitely wrong.\n\nSo I'll correct that line to x + min_key * i. That way, each key is adjusted by a unique amount based on its position, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as the key for sorting. Then it calls make_sort with these keys. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified, but in make_sort_freq, the keys are hist, which is already based on the frequency. So when make_sort is called, it's going to adjust these hist values by adding min_key * i. But hist is negative, so adding min_key * i (which is positive) might not be the right approach. Wait, no, because in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency come first. But when make_sort is called with min_key=1, it's adding 1 * i to each key. So for example, if two tokens have the same frequency (so same hist), their keys will be adjusted by their positions, ensuring uniqueness. That makes sense because the sort will then order them based on their original positions when frequencies are the same. So that part seems okay.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using hist as keys. So the keys are the negative frequencies. Then, in make_sort, these keys are being adjusted by adding min_key * i. So the sorting will be based on the adjusted keys, which are (-freq + i * min_key). Since min_key is 1, each key is unique because i is unique. So the sorting should first order by frequency (ascending because of the negative) and then by position. That should result in tokens being sorted by frequency, and for ties, by their original order. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), specifically the line where the keys are being modified. The bitwise shift is incorrect and should be replaced with a proper scaling or just addition.\n\nSo to fix make_sort(), I'll change the line in the SequenceMap from using >> to just adding min_key * i. So the corrected line would be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So perhaps the intention was to add a small value to x so that when x is the same, the i adds a unique offset. But using >> is wrong. So replacing it with addition is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the function signature has max_seq_len and min_key as parameters. But in the call to make_sort_unique, it's passing keys after modification. That should be correct.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort(), correcting the bitwise shift to a proper addition.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the line where keys are modified uses a bitwise shift incorrectly. Replace it with x + min_key * i.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with this fix.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2064, "total_tokens": 6683}}, {"id": "gen-1738410393-Yecde18qZFG8w3uV7GfZ", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410393, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, the primary issue was the incorrect use of bitwise shift instead of division in the `make_sort` function.

So maybe this function is fine.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key multiplied by their index, shifted by max_seq_len. The idea is to make keys unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique. Let me check the lambda: x + (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len. Wait, in Python, >> is bitwise shift, not division. Oh, that's a mistake.

But using bitwise shift here is incorrect because it's not scaling as intended. So this line needs fixing.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. Then it calls make_sort with hist, tokens, max_seq_len, and min_key=1. Wait, the parameters for make_sort are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). In make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which would set vals=rasp.tokens and keys=hist. But in make_sort, the function is defined as make_sort(vals, keys, ...). So when we call make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), it's correct because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency (hist). So that part seems okay.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But the original make_sort function's parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key).

So the correct expression is x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the parameters are correctly passed. The function is called with keys, vals, etc. So after fixing the lambda, this should work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1.

Hmm, but in the example, when using make_sort, the output is sorted. So maybe this function is working as intended. Not sure if there's an issue here.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort().

Using bitwise shift here would not scale the keys correctly, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nSo the problem is in the make_sort function where the keys are being modified incorrectly.

But wait, the parameters passed to make_sort are (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1). But looking at make_sort's definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So the function call should pass max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. In the current code, it's passing them positionally, which might cause issues. So I should change the function call to use keyword arguments for clarity and correctness.\n\nSo to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the lambda uses '>>' which is incorrect.

So I should change them to keyword arguments.\n\nLet me correct these points.\n\nFor the first issue, I'll replace '>> max_seq_len' with '/ max_seq_len' in the lambda function. That way, each key is adjusted by a unique amount based on its position, ensuring uniqueness without overlapping.\n\nFor the second issue, I'll modify the make_sort call in make_sort_freq to pass max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. This ensures that the function receives the correct parameters.\n\nI should also check if all functions are using the correct RASP operations and that there are no other syntax errors.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of this selector, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each position, it's counting how many keys are smaller than it. Then sel_new would select the position where the index matches this count. So for the first element (2), target_pos is 3, so it looks for index 3, which is the fourth element. But in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which suggests that the aggregation is picking the correct values. Hmm, maybe this function is correct as is.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key multiplied by the index, shifted by max_seq_len. The idea is to make keys unique by adding a unique offset based on their position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. Wait, the lambda in SequenceMap is x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. But in Python, >> is a bitwise shift. Oh, that's a problem. It should probably be a division, not a bitwise operation. So instead of shifting, it's dividing by max_seq_len. So the correct expression should be (x + min_key * i) / max_seq_len or something similar. Using bitwise shift here would cause unexpected results, especially if max_seq_len is a power of two, but it's not the intended operation. So that's a bug.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. The idea is that higher frequency tokens come first because their negative counts are smaller. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. However, in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1. So the keys would be (-hist) + 1 * index. But since hist is the frequency, this would adjust the sorting key to ensure uniqueness. But I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think: when sorting by frequency, tokens with higher frequency should come first. So using a negative histogram makes sense. But when there's a tie in frequency, the original order is preserved. By adding the index, we ensure that each key is unique, so the sort is stable. That seems correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), specifically the use of >> in the lambda function. I need to replace that with division. Also, I should ensure that the lambda is correctly adding min_key multiplied by the index and then scaling appropriately.\n\nWait, the original intention was to add a small value to each key based on its position to break ties. So the lambda should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. That way, each position adds a fraction that's unique but doesn't significantly affect the sorting order beyond breaking ties.\n\nSo in the code, the line should be changed from x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len to (x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len). But since we're dealing with integer operations, perhaps using division is better than bitwise shift.\n\nSo the corrected line in make_sort() would be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut wait, in Python, using / would result in a float. If the keys are integers, this might cause issues. Alternatively, perhaps using a small epsilon value, but since the RASP paper suggests using this approach, it's acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to check is the use of rasp.tokens in make_sort_freq(). The function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which is correct because vals are the tokens, and keys are the hist.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort(), correcting the bitwise shift to a division.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1771, "total_tokens": 6390}}, {"id": "gen-1738410658-Vhn4we0BQ5dUY6gnmURJ", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410658, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort` function where a bitwise shift operation was incorrectly used.

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each function is supposed to do.\n\nThe make_hist function is supposed to return the number of times each token occurs in the input. It uses rasp.Select with EQ comparison to create a selector where each element is True if tokens are equal. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues in each row, which gives the frequency. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the make_sort_unique function. It's supposed to sort values based on keys, assuming unique keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of Trues, which gives the position each key should move to. Then it selects elements where the target position equals the index and aggregates. That makes sense for unique keys.\n\nNow, the make_sort function. It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique using max_seq_len and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key multiplied by the index, shifted by max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda is x + (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len. Oh, wait, in Python, >> is bitwise shift. So this would add min_key * i and then right-shift by max_seq_len bits, which doesn't make sense. That's probably a bug. It should instead add a value that ensures uniqueness without bitwise operations. Maybe it's supposed to scale the index so that each key is unique. So perhaps the intention was x + min_key * i, but then divided or scaled somehow. Alternatively, maybe it's x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, but using bitwise shift is incorrect.\n\nSo that line is definitely wrong. Instead of using >>, it should probably be something else. Let me think: the goal is to make each key unique by adding a small value based on their position. So for each key x at position i, the new key is x + min_key * i. But since i can be up to max_seq_len-1, min_key should be chosen such that min_key * max_seq_len is less than the difference between consecutive keys. But the current code uses a bitwise shift, which is not the right approach. So I'll need to fix that line.\n\nThen, in make_sort_freq, it calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the hist is negative, so when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. But in make_sort, the keys are being adjusted, which might not be necessary here since the hist is already unique? Or maybe not. Hmm, but the make_sort function is designed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them. So perhaps that's okay.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort, specifically the line where keys are modified. Let me correct that.\n\nInstead of using >>, I should just add min_key multiplied by the index. So the lambda should be lambda x, i: x + min_key * i. But wait, the original code had x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. That's likely a mistake. So I'll change it to x + (min_key * i).\n\nWait, but in the example given, when make_sort is called with min_key=1 and max_seq_len=5, for the input [2,4,3,1], the keys become 2+1*0=2, 4+1*1=5, 3+1*2=5, 1+1*3=4. Wait, that would cause 4 and 5 to appear twice, which isn't unique. Oh, that's a problem. So perhaps the approach of adding min_key * i isn't sufficient to ensure uniqueness.\n\nWait, maybe the original intention was to scale the index such that each addition is smaller than the min_key difference. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be x + (min_key / max_seq_len) * i, so that each step is a fraction that doesn't cause overlaps. But since we're dealing with integers, maybe it's better to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be x + min_key * (i / max_seq_len), but that might not be integer. Hmm, maybe the original code was trying to add a value that's smaller than the min_key, ensuring that the modified keys are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add min_key * i, but then the keys will be unique as long as min_key is larger than the maximum possible difference between any two keys. But that's not practical. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be x + (min_key ** i), but that could get too big.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code was using a bitwise shift to scale the index. For example, if max_seq_len is 5, then shifting by 5 bits would multiply by 32. So min_key * i >> max_seq_len would be min_key * i / 32. But that's probably not the right approach either.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code was supposed to add min_key multiplied by the index, but the >> operator was a typo. So the correct line should be x + min_key * i. So I'll change that.\n\nSo in make_sort, the line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nBut wait, in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], with min_key=1 and max_seq_len=4 (since indices are 0-based), the modified keys would be:\n\n2 + 1*0 = 2\n\n4 + 1*1 =5\n\n3 +1*2=5\n\n1 +1*3=4\n\nSo the keys become [2,5,5,4], which still have duplicates. So this approach doesn't ensure uniqueness. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the way to make keys unique is to add a value that's unique for each position, such that even if two x's are the same, their modified keys will be different. So for example, x + min_key * i, where min_key is larger than the maximum possible x. But that's not feasible if x can be any number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be x + (min_key / max_seq_len) * i, but that would require floating points, which may not be desired.\n\nWait, perhaps the original approach in the RASP paper used a different method. Let me recall: in the paper, they added a small epsilon value based on the position to break ties. So for each key, the new key is x + epsilon * i, where epsilon is a small value that doesn't interfere with the sorting order beyond the tie-breaking.\n\nSo in the code, perhaps the lambda should be x + (min_key * i) / (max_seq_len ** 2), or something similar to ensure that the added value is smaller than the min_key difference.\n\nBut in the code, the current approach is using bitwise shift, which is incorrect. So I'll replace that with adding min_key * i, but perhaps scale it down.\n\nWait, but in the function's docstring, it says that this approach only works for numerical keys. So perhaps the keys are integers, and adding min_key * i would make them unique as long as min_key is at least 1 and i is unique for each position.\n\nWait, in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], after adding 1*i, the keys become [2,5,5,4]. Oh, wait, that's not unique. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe goal is to make the keys unique so that when sorted, each key has a unique position. So for each key x at position i, we can create a new key that is x plus a term that ensures uniqueness. One way is to add a value that is unique per position and smaller than the minimum difference between any two x's.\n\nBut since we don't know the x's in advance, perhaps the approach is to add a value that is based on the position, scaled such that it's smaller than the minimum possible difference between x's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use a different formula. Maybe x + (min_key / max_seq_len) * i, so that each addition is a fraction that doesn't cause overlaps.\n\nBut in the code, the current line is x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So for example, if max_seq_len is 5, then i can be 0-4. So for i=4, min_key *4 >>5 would be min_key *4 /32. So if min_key is 1, then it's 4/32=0.125. So the new key would be x + 0.125*i.\n\nWait, that might work because the added value is smaller than 1, so if x's are integers, the new keys would be unique as long as the original x's are unique or the added value makes them unique.\n\nBut in the example, the original x's are [2,4,3,1]. Adding 0.125*i:\n\ni=0: 2 +0=2\n\ni=1:4 +0.125=4.125\n\ni=2:3 +0.25=3.25\n\ni=3:1 +0.375=1.375\n\nSo the new keys are [2,4.125,3.25,1.375], which are all unique. So when sorted, the order would be 1.375, 2, 3.25,4.125, which corresponds to the original indices 3,0,2,1. So the sorted values would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the lambda is x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So if min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is 5, then it's x + (i >>5). But i is 0-4, so i>>5 is 0 for all i. So that would not change x at all. That can't be right. So that's definitely a bug.\n\nSo the correct approach is to replace the >> with something else. Perhaps it's a typo, and the intended operation was multiplication, not bitwise shift. Or maybe it's supposed to be division.\n\nWait, perhaps the code was supposed to be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. So in the lambda, it would be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. But in Python, using / would produce a float, which might be acceptable if the keys are numerical.\n\nSo the corrected line would be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nBut wait, in the example where max_seq_len is 5 and min_key is 1, for i=0: x+0, i=1: x+0.2, i=2: x+0.4, etc. So for x=2,4,3,1:\n\ni=0: 2+0=2\n\ni=1:4+0.2=4.2\n\ni=2:3+0.4=3.4\n\ni=3:1+0.6=1.6\n\nSo the keys are [2,4.2,3.4,1.6], which are unique. So when sorted, the order is 1.6,2,3.4,4.2, which corresponds to indices 3,0,2,1. So the sorted values would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo that seems to fix the issue. So the lambda should be x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code intended to use a bitwise shift, but that's incorrect. So the fix is to replace the >> with /.\n\nSo in the make_sort function, I'll correct that line.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated. So when used as keys in make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency will come first. But in the example given, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorting is by frequency descending, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort, the keys are being adjusted, so even if two tokens have the same frequency, their adjusted keys will be unique, ensuring a total order.\n\nSo the main issue is the bitwise shift in make_sort. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function would have the lambda as x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len.\n\nWait, but in Python, the division operator / returns a float. If the keys are integers, this would convert them to floats. But in RASP, the operations should handle that as long as they're numerical.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected code would be:\n\nIn make_sort, replace the lambda with x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len.\n\nSo the line becomes:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nI think that's the main fix needed.\n\nLet me check the other functions for any issues.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the code seems correct. It creates a 'smaller' selector, then gets the count of Trues as target_pos. Then selects where target_pos equals indices and aggregates. That should correctly sort the values.\n\nIn make_hist, it's correct as well.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, it's using make_sort with hist as keys.

Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct because each token's count is the number of times it appears. So I don't think there's an issue here.\n\nNext, looking at `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target position by taking the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by comparing target_pos with indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. This should correctly sort the values based on keys, assuming all keys are unique. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, the `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)` function. It modifies the keys by adding `min_key * i >> max_seq_len`. Wait, the lambda is `lambda x, i: x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len`. Oh, wait, in Python, the bitwise shift operator >> has higher precedence than addition, so this is parsed as x + (min_key * i >> max_seq_len), which is not the intended behavior. The intention is probably to add a unique offset to each key based on their position to ensure uniqueness. So the correct expression should be (x + (min_key * i)) shifted, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the intended operation is x + (min_key * (i >> max_seq_len)), but that also doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the idea is to add min_key multiplied by the index, but then shift it to make room for the original key. Or perhaps the lambda is incorrectly written. Let me think: the goal is to make each key unique by adding a value based on their position. So for each key x at position i, the new key should be x + min_key * i. But the current code does x + (min_key * i >> max_seq_len), which is incorrect because it's shifting the product, not adding it as a unique offset. So the lambda should be `x + min_key * i`, without the shift. The shift was a mistake here. So I need to correct that line.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It computes the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls `make_sort` with hist as keys. But wait, in the original code, the parameters for `make_sort` are `vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key`. In `make_sort_freq`, the call is `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)`. But looking at the definition of `make_sort`, the parameters are `vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float`. So the function expects `vals` and `keys` as the first two arguments, followed by keyword arguments for max_seq_len and min_key. The call in `make_sort_freq` is correct because it's passing `rasp.tokens` as vals and `hist` as keys, then the other parameters as keywords. So that part is okay.\n\nWait, but in the `make_sort` function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i. But in `make_sort_freq`, the min_key is set to 1. So each key (which is the negative histogram) will have 1 * i added to it. That should ensure that tokens with the same frequency are sorted by their original positions, which is correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in the `make_sort` function's lambda. The incorrect use of the bitwise shift operator is causing the keys to be modified incorrectly. I need to fix that line.\n\nSo, in the `make_sort` function, the line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\ninstead of the current lambda which includes the shift.\n\nLet me also check if the parameters are correctly passed. The function `make_sort` is called in `make_sort_freq` with `max_seq_len` and `min_key=1`. The `max_seq_len` is used in the `rasp.indices` which is fine because `rasp.indices` returns the position indices, which go up to max_seq_len -1. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in the `make_sort` function, the `rasp.SequenceMap` is being used correctly. It applies the lambda to each pair of elements from `keys` and `rasp.indices`, which gives x (the key) and i (the index). So adding min_key * i to x is the right approach to ensure unique keys.\n\nSo the only correction needed is in the lambda of `make_sort` function, removing the `>> max_seq_len` part.\n\nLet me also check if the `make_sort` function's docstring is correct. It says that the approach only works for numerical keys, which is true because adding min_key * i is a numerical operation.\n\nSo, to summarize, the error is in the lambda function inside `make_sort`. The bitwise shift is incorrect and should be removed. The corrected line should be `x + min_key * i`.\n\nNow, I'll provide the corrected code with this fix.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1936, "total_tokens": 6555}}, {"id": "gen-1738410857-Xzpn7CmBvSomZSKBt6CC", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410857, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, the primary correction was in the `make_sort` function where a bitwise shift was incorrectly used.

It modifies the keys by adding min_key multiplied by the index, shifted by max_seq_len. The idea is to make keys unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique.

So the correct expression should be (x + (min_key * i)) / max_seq_len or x + (min_key * i / max_seq_len). Otherwise, using >> would cause incorrect scaling, especially if max_seq_len is a power of two, but it's still wrong because it's a bitwise operation, not a float division.\n\nSo I need to fix that line. Instead of using >>, it should be divided by max_seq_len. So the lambda should be lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. That way, each key is adjusted by a small amount based on its position, ensuring uniqueness without affecting the sort order significantly.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it so that higher frequencies come first, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1. So the keys would be -hist + 1 * i / max_seq_len. That should ensure that when frequencies are the same, the earlier tokens come first because their indices are smaller, which makes sense. So this function seems okay once make_sort is fixed.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), specifically the bitwise shift. I'll correct that by replacing the >> with division.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position exactly once, and aggregate should pick the correct value. Hmm, maybe this is correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index shifted by max_seq_len. The lambda is x + (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len. Wait, in Python, >> is bitwise shift, but here it's probably intended to be division. Oh, that's a mistake. It should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len or something else, not a bitwise shift. That's definitely an error because using >> would cause unexpected key values, especially if max_seq_len is a large number.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the line where keys are modified is incorrect. Instead of using >>, it should use division or another method to ensure uniqueness. For example, x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len would spread the keys enough to make them unique.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, the hist is negated, so lower frequencies come first. But when sorting, using make_sort with these hist values as keys should arrange the tokens by frequency. However, in the example given, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let me see: the histogram is [2,1,1,1], so negated it's [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the tokens with higher frequency (lower negated hist) come first. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So maybe this part is okay.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but the parameters for make_sort are (vals, keys, ...). So in this case, vals is rasp.tokens and keys is hist. So the function is sorting the tokens based on their hist values. That seems correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort() where the bitwise shift is used instead of division. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i divided by max_seq_len. But using bitwise shift here is wrong. So I'll replace the >> with /.\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So the order of operations would do the shift first, then add. That's not correct. It should be (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, then add to x.\n\nSo the correct line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nBut wait, in RASP, all operations must produce sequences of the same length. Using division here might cause issues if max_seq_len is zero, but since it's a parameter provided by the user, we can assume it's positive.\n\nSo the fix is to change the lambda function in make_sort() to use division instead of bitwise shift.\n\nLet me also check if there are other issues. For example, in make_sort_unique(), when using rasp.Aggregate, the default is None, which is correct because the user mentioned to leave it as None.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, but make_sort() is using these negated values as keys. Since make_sort() sorts in ascending order, using negated hist would sort from lowest to highest, which corresponds to highest frequency first. That's correct.\n\nSo the main problem is the bitwise shift in make_sort().

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of this selector, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals with this selector. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,0,1,2], right? Because for each position, how many keys are smaller. So for key 2, there are 3 smaller (1,3,4?), no, wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Hmm, maybe the logic is correct because when you aggregate, each position in vals is selected where the target_pos matches the index. So for the first position, target_pos is 3, so it's looking for index 3, which is the fourth element. So the first element in the output would be the value at index 3, which is 1. That makes sense. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique using max_seq_len and min_key. The current code is modifying the keys by adding min_key * i, where i is the index. But the way it's written is x + (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len. Wait, that's a bitwise shift, not division. Oh, that's a mistake. It should be divided by max_seq_len, not shifted. So the line should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. Because the idea is to add a small value based on the index to make keys unique. Using a bitwise shift would change the value dramatically, which isn't intended. So that's a bug.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. But wait, when you negate the histogram, the most frequent tokens will have the smallest (most negative) keys, so when sorted in ascending order, they'll come first. But in the example given, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the histogram is [2,1,2,1], so negated it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The keys are these values. So when sorted, the order would be based on these keys. The smallest is -2, then -2, then -1, then -1. So the sorted order would be the first and third elements first, then the second and fourth. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but hist is the negated histogram. So the keys are the negated histogram, and the values are the tokens. So when sorted, the tokens are ordered by their histogram counts, from highest to lowest. So that should work.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the bitwise shift is used instead of division. Let me correct that line.\n\nSo, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified with x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. I'll change that to x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. That way, each key gets a unique offset based on its position, ensuring that keys are unique for sorting.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any possible issues. In make_sort_unique(), when using Aggregate, the default is None, which is correct. The same goes for other Aggregate calls.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified, but what if the original keys are not numeric? Well, the note says it's only for numerical keys, so that's fine.\n\nSo, the main fix is in make_sort(), correcting the bitwise shift to a division.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1718, "total_tokens": 6337}}, {"id": "gen-1738411031-WvZ6JroVkKEkkTp82opc", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411031, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort()` function where a bitwise right shift was incorrectly used instead of division.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position in the sorted order is determined by how many are smaller. So sel_new would select the correct positions. Then Aggregate should pick the corresponding vals. That seems correct for unique keys. So maybe no issue here.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * index to each key. Wait, the lambda is x + (min_key * i) >> max_seq_len. Wait, what's >> here? Oh, in Python, that's a bitwise right shift. That doesn't make sense in this context. It should probably be a division or something else to ensure uniqueness. But using bitwise shift would not scale correctly, especially if max_seq_len is large. So this is a bug.\n\nFor example, if min_key is 1 and i is 1, then 1 *1=1, so x+1. But if i is 2, x+2, etc. But if the keys are the same, adding i (scaled by min_key) would make them unique. However, using >> would not add, but instead perform a bitwise operation. So that's incorrect. It should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len or something else that ensures the added value is small enough not to interfere with the sorting order beyond ensuring uniqueness.\n\nWait, the original intention is to add a small value to each key such that when keys are the same, their order is determined by their position. So for keys [2,4,3,1], after processing, they become [2 + 1*0, 4 +1*1, 3 +1*2, 1 +1*3] = [2,5,5,4]. Wait, that might not be correct. Or perhaps the idea is to add a value that is smaller than the min_key step. Hmm, maybe the correct approach is to add (min_key * i) scaled by something that makes it smaller than the min_key, so that when keys are the same, the added part ensures they are unique but doesn't affect the overall order.\n\nWait, perhaps the lambda should be x + (min_key * i) / (max_seq_len). That way, the added value is a fraction, ensuring that when x's are the same, the i's make them unique, but the added part is less than min_key, so the sorting order is preserved. For example, if x is 2 for two positions, the first would be 2 + 1*0/5=2, the second 2 +1*1/5=2.2. So when sorted, the first comes before the second.\n\nSo in the code, the lambda is x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. But >> is a bitwise shift, which is equivalent to dividing by 2^max_seq_len. That's probably not intended. Instead, it should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, but in Python, division is done with /, not >>.\n\nSo the bug is in the lambda function. It should be using division, not bitwise shift. So I need to correct that line.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, hist is the count of each token. So when we negate it, the more frequent tokens have lower values, so when sorted in ascending order, they come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] has hist [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The keys for sorting would be [-2, -1, -2, -1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these keys. But wait, the example expects [2,2,4,1], which is the input sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). So the sorted output should group the 2's first, then 4 and 1. But the current approach might not handle this correctly because the keys are the same for different elements. So when keys are the same, the make_sort function uses the modified keys, which include the index to break ties. So in the example, the hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The make_sort function would then adjust these keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Let's say min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is 4. So the adjusted keys would be:\n\nFor each element i (0-based):\n\n- i=0: -2 + 1*0/4 = -2.0\n- i=1: -1 + 1*1/4 = -0.75\n- i=2: -2 + 1*2/4 = -1.5\n- i=3: -1 + 1*3/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the adjusted keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -1.5, -0.25]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be:\n\n-2.0 (i=0), -1.5 (i=2), -0.75 (i=1), -0.25 (i=3). So the sorted indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1). So the keys are hist, which is the frequency count. But in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So that should correctly break ties.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the lambda uses >> instead of division.\n\nSo to fix it, I need to change the lambda in make_sort() from x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len to x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len.\n\nWait, but in Python, the >> operator is bitwise right shift. So for example, 3 >> 2 is 0. So using it here would not add the desired value. So replacing it with division is necessary.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being reassigned. The function parameter is keys, and then inside, keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...). That's correct because it's creating a new SOp.\n\nSo the corrected line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So I need to replace >> with /.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the lambda is written as x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So that's x + (min_key * i).bitwise_right_shift(max_seq_len). Which is not the intended behavior. So yes, changing to division.\n\nAnother consideration: using division might introduce floats. But in the RASP paper, the example uses integers, but the code should handle floats as well.\n\nSo the fix is to correct the lambda in make_sort().\n\nNow, let me check the other functions again.\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), when it creates sel_new, it's a Select between target_pos and rasp.indices with EQ. Then Aggregate uses sel_new to select vals. That should correctly pick the values at the sorted positions. So that seems correct.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated so that higher frequencies come first when sorted in ascending order. Then make_sort is called with the negated hist as keys. So that should work.\n\nSo the only bug is in make_sort(), where the lambda uses >> instead of /.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort() should have the lambda as x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the lambda is x + min_key * i >> max_seq_len. So the operator is >>, which is a bitwise shift. So I need to replace that with division.\n\nSo the corrected line is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut wait, in Python, the operator precedence might cause issues. So adding parentheses to ensure the multiplication happens before division.\n\nAlternatively, it could be written as x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len.\n\nYes, that should fix it.\n\nSo the final step is to update the make_sort() function accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2838, "total_tokens": 7457}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
