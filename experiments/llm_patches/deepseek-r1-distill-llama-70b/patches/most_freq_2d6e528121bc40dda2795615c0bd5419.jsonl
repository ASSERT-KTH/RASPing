Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each key, it's the count of keys less than it. So when we select where target_pos equals indices, for each position i, we select the element at position i in the original. So when we aggregate, each position i will pick the i-th smallest element. That makes sense. So maybe this function is correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i | max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Oh, wait, in Python, | is a bitwise OR, but here it's probably intended to be a bitwise OR with max_seq_len. But that might not make sense because adding and then ORing could cause issues. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be something else, like a multiplication or addition. Alternatively, perhaps the intention is to create unique keys by adding a value based on their position. Let me think: the original RASP paper's make_sort function uses a similar approach but with a different way to ensure uniqueness. Here, the code is trying to add min_key * i, but then OR with max_seq_len. That doesn't seem right. For example, if max_seq_len is 5 (binary 101), and i is 1, then 1 | 5 is 5, which might not help in making the keys unique. So perhaps this is a mistake. Maybe the intended operation is addition, not OR. So the line should be x + min_key * i, without the OR. That would make the keys unique by adding a small value based on their position.\n\nSo the problem is in the make_sort() function where the keys are being modified incorrectly. Instead of using |, it should use +. So I'll need to correct that line.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as keys, tokens as vals, and some parameters. Wait, in the example, when the input is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. But the example output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the tokens are ordered by their frequency, with higher frequency first. So the code seems correct here because the keys are negated, so lower (more negative) values come first, meaning higher frequency tokens appear earlier.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is using hist as the key. So in the example, the hist is [2,1,2,1], so the keys after negation are [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be based on these keys. So the first token (2) has key -2, the second (4) has -1, the third (2) has -2, and the fourth (1) has -1. So when sorted, the keys would be ordered as -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to the tokens [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the keys are being modified with a bitwise OR instead of addition. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the make_sort() function, the line:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nshould be changed to:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but why is max_seq_len being used here? Oh, perhaps the original intention was to add min_key multiplied by i, and then maybe add max_seq_len? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the code was supposed to add min_key * (i | max_seq_len), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the code was supposed to add min_key * i and then add max_seq_len, but that's unclear. But given the context, the most logical correction is to remove the | max_seq_len part because using OR here doesn't make sense for ensuring uniqueness. So the lambda should just be x + min_key * i.\n\nWait, but in the original RASP paper, the make_sort function uses a similar approach where they add a small value (like epsilon) multiplied by the position to break ties. So in this code, min_key is that epsilon, and i is the position. So the correct way is to add min_key * i to x, ensuring that each key is unique based on their position if they have the same value.\n\nSo the mistake is the use of | instead of +. So I'll correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the parameters are max_seq_len and min_key. But in the function definition, it's written as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nWait, but in the call to make_sort in make_sort_freq(), it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the error is in make_sort() where the lambda uses | instead of +. Correcting that should fix the program.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort() would be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nI'll make that change.\n\nNow, let me check if there are any other issues. For example, in make_sort_unique(), when using rasp.Aggregate, the default is None, which is correct as per the guidelines.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, which is done by multiplying by -1. But in RASP, can you multiply a sequence by a scalar? Because rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist) would be the correct way. Using the unary operator might not be directly applicable. Wait, in the code, it's written as hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). But in RASP, can you multiply an SOp by a scalar? Looking at the source code, I don't see a Multiply operation, but perhaps the rasp.Map function can be used. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using operator overloading, but in the provided source code, there's no __mul__ method for SOp. So this might be an issue.\n\nWait, in the source code, the SOp classes like Map and SequenceMap are defined, but there's no operator overloading for multiplication. So the line hist = -1 * make_hist() would not work because you can't multiply an SOp by an integer. So this is another error.\n\nSo, to negate the histogram, we need to use rasp.Map. So the correct way is:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nshould be replaced with:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nThat's another correction needed.\n\nSo now, I have two corrections to make:\n\n1. In make_sort(), fix the lambda to use + instead of |.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), replace the multiplication with a Map to negate.\n\nLet me check if there are any other issues.\n\nLooking at make_sort_unique(), when it's called from make_sort(), it's passed the modified keys. So that should be correct after the first fix.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the function is supposed to return the sorted vals. So after modifying the keys correctly, it should work.\n\nSo, to recap, the two main issues are:\n\n- Incorrect use of | in make_sort().\n- Incorrect negation in make_sort_freq().\n\nI'll correct both.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n\nIn make_sort(), the corrected line is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the corrected line is:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure there are no other issues.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the parameters are correctly passed. The function is called with max_seq_len and min_key, which are used correctly after the fix.\n\nSo, the final code should have these corrections.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2818, "total_tokens": 7437}}, {"id": "gen-1738410422-2KckvX0akHNqFEbGaPjG", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410422, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified that the `make_sort` function incorrectly used a bitwise OR operation when modifying keys, which was causing incorrect key values.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears by selecting all positions where the token is equal and then counting the Trues. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, which should give the sorted order. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each key's count of smaller keys is 0,1,2,3. So sel_new would select the position where target_pos equals the index. So for index 0, it's where target_pos is 0, which is the first element. For index 1, where target_pos is 1, which is the second element, etc. So when we aggregate, each position picks the corresponding val. That should sort the vals based on keys. But wait, the example shows that make_sort_unique is called with keys as rasp.tokens, and the output is sorted. So maybe this function is correct.\n\nBut looking at the make_sort() function. It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i to each key, where i is the index. So for each key x at position i, it becomes x + min_key * i. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That should ensure that keys are unique because each position adds a unique value based on index. So when sorted, the original order is preserved for equal keys because their modified keys will be in the order of their indices. Wait, but in the example given, when keys are [2,4,1,2], the modified keys would be 2 + 1*0=2, 4 +1*1=5, 1 +1*2=3, 2 +1*3=5. Wait, that's not unique. Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The function uses max_seq_len as a multiplier. Oh, the code is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Wait, that's a bitwise OR, which might not be the intended operation. Oh, that's probably a mistake. It should be addition, not bitwise OR. So the line should be x + min_key * i, not x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Because using OR could cause unexpected results, especially if max_seq_len is a power of two or something. So that's a bug.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the keys are being modified incorrectly. Instead of adding, it's using a bitwise OR. That would mess up the key values. So I need to fix that line.\n\nThen, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it (so higher frequency comes first), and then uses make_sort with these hist as keys. But wait, the hist is computed as the count, so negating it would sort in ascending order of frequency. But when frequencies are the same, the original order should be preserved. However, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i, which in this case, min_key is 1, so each key is hist + 1 * i. So for tokens with the same frequency, their modified keys would be frequency + index, ensuring uniqueness. So when sorted, tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original positions. That seems correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the keys are being modified with a bitwise OR instead of addition. So I need to change that line.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). But in the function, it's using rasp.SequenceMap with keys and rasp.indices. The lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. As I said, the | is wrong. It should be x + min_key * i. But wait, the original code in the RASP paper might have used a different approach, perhaps ensuring that the added value is smaller than the min difference between keys. But in any case, the bitwise OR is definitely incorrect here.\n\nSo the correction is to replace the | with +. So the line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. That's probably a typo. So I'll correct that.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any issues. In make_sort_unique(), when creating sel_new, it's using rasp.Select with target_pos and rasp.indices, comparing for equality. That should correctly select the position where the target_pos (number of smaller keys) equals the index, which corresponds to the sorted order. So that seems correct.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. Then, make_sort is called with hist as keys, which after negation, will sort the tokens by frequency. And for ties, the index is used because of the min_key * i addition. So that should work.\n\nSo the main bug is in make_sort(), where the bitwise OR is used instead of addition. Correcting that should fix the program.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the make_sort() function, the parameters are max_seq_len and min_key. But in the code, max_seq_len is used as a multiplier in the bitwise OR, which is incorrect. So after fixing, it's not used anymore. Wait, no, the corrected code doesn't use max_seq_len at all. So perhaps the function's parameters are incorrect. Wait, the function is supposed to ensure that the keys are unique by adding min_key * i. So max_seq_len is passed but not used in the corrected code. That's okay because the function's purpose is to modify the keys to be unique, and the way to do it is by adding min_key * i, which ensures that each key is unique because i is unique. So max_seq_len is not needed in the key modification. It was probably a leftover from a different approach.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the key modification was x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. That might have been intended to shift the keys into a different range. But using OR is incorrect. So perhaps the intended operation was addition. So the corrected line should be x + min_key * i + max_seq_len? Or maybe x + (min_key * i) ? I think the original intention was to add a unique value based on the index to make the keys unique, so using x + min_key * i is sufficient. The max_seq_len parameter might not be necessary in this approach, but since it's a parameter, perhaps it's used elsewhere or for ensuring the keys are within a certain range. But in the current code, after the fix, max_seq_len isn't used. So perhaps the function should be adjusted to use max_seq_len correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code intended to add min_key * (i | max_seq_len), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be x + min_key * (i | max_seq_len), but that also doesn't make sense. No, I think the main issue is that it's using | instead of +. So the correction is to change | to +.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main issue is in make_sort(), where the key modification uses | instead of +.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is then created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position exactly once. That should correctly sort the values. Hmm, maybe this is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the lambda in SequenceMap is using |, which is a bitwise OR. Oh, that's a mistake. It should be a plus sign. Using bitwise OR here doesn't make sense because it's supposed to add a unique offset based on position. So I need to change 'x + min_key * i | max_seq_len' to 'x + min_key * i + max_seq_len' or just 'x + min_key * i'. Wait, the original code in the example uses x + min_key * i, so the | is a typo. That's definitely an error.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the parameters passed to make_sort are (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But looking at make_sort's definition, the first two arguments are vals and keys. So in this case, vals is rasp.tokens and keys is hist. But in make_sort, the function is supposed to sort vals based on the keys. So when we negate the histogram, lower values (higher frequency) will come first. But the example given is [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So the keys would be [-2, -1, -2, -1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these keys. But since make_sort uses the keys to determine the order, the tokens with lower keys (more negative) come first. So 2 (key -2) comes before 4 (key -1). So the output is [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the keys are the histogram counts, and the values are the tokens. So the sorting is based on the histogram counts. But since the histogram is negated, higher frequency tokens have lower keys, so they appear earlier. That makes sense.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the bitwise OR is used instead of addition. I need to correct that line.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. In make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. But the way it's written, it's x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. That's incorrect. It should be x + min_key * i. Or perhaps x + (min_key * i) to ensure each key is unique. So I'll change the | to +.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the lambda function is using 'i' as the index, which is correct because it's using rasp.indices. So the code should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Oh, I see, the | is a typo. So replacing that with +.\n\nSo the corrected line in make_sort() should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nI think that's the main issue. Let me make sure there are no other problems.\n\nLooking at the function definitions, all the necessary imports are there, and the functions are properly structured. So the only repair needed is fixing the typo in make_sort().\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1759, "total_tokens": 6378}}, {"id": "gen-1738410601-Oe6vo7hG1uXXJPrZZQML", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410601, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort` function where the keys were being modified incorrectly using a bitwise OR operation.

It uses rasp.Select with EQ to create a selector and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's an issue here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by comparing keys with LT. Then it gets the target_pos using SelectorWidth, which gives the number of elements less than each key. Then it selects elements where target_pos equals indices and aggregates vals. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So selecting where target_pos equals indices would pick the correct positions. But I'm not sure if this handles all cases correctly. Maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i | max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Oh, wait, that's a bitwise OR, not a logical OR. That might be a mistake. Because if max_seq_len is, say, 5, then i is the index, which starts at 0. So for each key x, it's x + min_key * i, then OR with max_seq_len. That doesn't make sense because OR would set certain bits, which could disrupt the actual value. Instead, it should probably be adding a small value to make keys unique, not using bitwise operations. So this line is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is in the make_sort() function where the keys are being modified. The intention is to add a small value based on the index to ensure uniqueness, but using | (bitwise OR) is wrong. It should be adding a fractional part, perhaps, but since the keys are numerical, adding min_key * i would create unique keys by offsetting each position slightly.\n\nWait, looking at the code: the lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. That's x plus (min_key multiplied by i) bitwise OR with max_seq_len. That's not right. It should be x + min_key * i, without the OR. The OR is causing the keys to have bits set based on max_seq_len, which isn't the intended behavior.\n\nSo I need to correct that line. Instead of using |, it should just add. So the correct line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but the original code had a | max_seq_len. That's definitely a bug. So removing that part.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, the hist is computed as the count of each token. So when we negate it, tokens with higher frequency get lower values, so sorting in ascending order would place them first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the tokens with lower negated hist (i.e., higher original count) come first. So in the example, the two 2's have -2, which is lower than -1, so they come before 4 and 1. So the sorted order is correct.\n\nBut wait, the make_sort function is called with hist as keys. So in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i. But in make_sort_freq, min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is passed. So that should handle tie-breaking by index, ensuring that tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original positions.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the keys are being incorrectly modified with a bitwise OR. I need to fix that.\n\nSo, to summarize, the bug is in make_sort() where the lambda uses | instead of just adding. So I'll correct that line.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all functions are using the correct operations and that there are no other issues.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in make_sort(), the function is supposed to take max_seq_len and min_key as parameters, which are used to make the keys unique. So the correction should ensure that each key is unique by adding a small value based on the index.\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort() function should have the lambda without the | max_seq_len part.\n\nLet me rewrite that part:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, each key is x plus min_key multiplied by the index, ensuring that each key is unique within the sequence.\n\nI think that's the main issue. Let me check if there are other potential problems.\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), when using rasp.Aggregate, the default is None, which is correct because the user instruction says to leave default as None.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated so that higher frequencies come first when sorted in ascending order. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in make_sort(), correcting the lambda in SequenceMap.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1931, "total_tokens": 6550}}, {"id": "gen-1738410675-vVgtBbsgzPZo4KQx0uic", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410675, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main issue was in the `make_sort` function where the lambda incorrectly used a bitwise OR operation.

That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The idea is to find the position where each element should be placed. Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals based on that selector. Wait, but if multiple elements have the same key, this might cause problems because the selector might select multiple positions. But the function is supposed to handle only unique keys, so maybe it's okay. Hmm, perhaps the issue is that when aggregating, if the selector has multiple True values, it averages, but we want to take the first or specific one. But the note says to avoid using Aggregate with selectors that have more than one True per row. So in make_sort_unique, if keys are unique, each row of the selector will have exactly one True, so it's safe. So maybe this function is okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * index. Then calls make_sort_unique. Let me check the line where keys are modified. The code is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, the lambda function is using a bitwise OR with max_seq_len. That doesn't make sense. It should probably be adding to make the keys unique, not OR. Because if x is a number and i is an index, adding min_key * i will shift each key by a unique amount based on their position, ensuring uniqueness. Using OR would not necessarily achieve that, especially if max_seq_len is a fixed number. So this is a bug. The correct operation should be addition, not bitwise OR.\n\nSo the line should be x + (min_key * i), but wait, the original code uses | max_seq_len. That's incorrect. So I need to fix that.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then sorts based on that. The issue might be in how the histogram is used. Wait, hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(), which would give negative counts. Then it's used as keys in make_sort. So lower counts come first. But when there's a tie in counts, the original order is preserved because the sort is stable. That seems correct. But let me check the parameters passed to make_sort. The call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). Wait, hist is the negative of the counts. So min_key is 1, which is added to each key as per make_sort's logic. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. So if hist is negative, adding min_key * index (which is positive) could make the keys unique. But I'm not sure if that's the intended behavior. Alternatively, perhaps the min_key should be negative to ensure that when added, the keys are unique. But I'm not sure. The main issue I spotted earlier is in make_sort's lambda using | instead of +.\n\nSo the main repair is in make_sort's SequenceMap function. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So when calling make_sort in make_sort_freq, it's passing max_seq_len and min_key correctly.\n\nWait, in the original make_sort function, the code is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut I think it should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBecause using | max_seq_len doesn't make sense. It's likely a typo, and the intended operation is addition.\n\nSo the corrected line should remove the | max_seq_len part.\n\nWait, no, the original code in the user's question has:\n\nlambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len\n\nWhich is x + (min_key * i) | max_seq_len. But that's a bitwise OR with max_seq_len, which is not the intended behavior. It should be x + min_key * i + max_seq_len? Or perhaps x + (min_key * i). Wait, the RASP paper's implementation might have a different approach, but in the given code, the idea is to add a unique value to each key based on its position to ensure uniqueness. So the correct way is to add min_key multiplied by the index (i) to each key. So the lambda should be x + (min_key * i). So the code should be:\n\nlambda x, i: x + min_key * i\n\nSo the | max_seq_len is incorrect and should be removed.\n\nSo that's the main issue to fix.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq(), when creating hist, it's using make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is correct. Then it's negated, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_unique(), the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). But according to the rules, Aggregate should have default=None, which it does here. So that's correct.\n\nSo the main repair is in make_sort's SequenceMap lambda.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort(), correct the lambda in SequenceMap from using | to just adding min_key * i.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort() is:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nWait, but in the original code, the lambda was x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. So I need to remove the | max_seq_len part.\n\nSo that's the main fix.\n\nI think that's the only issue. Let me check the other functions again.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is correct, passing max_seq_len and min_key=1. So that should be fine.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), the modified keys are passed to make_sort_unique(), which expects unique keys. By adding min_key * i, we ensure that each key is unique, so the function should work correctly.\n\nI think that's the main repair needed. So the corrected code will have the lambda in make_sort() fixed.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2470, "total_tokens": 7089}}, {"id": "gen-1738410757-5bBCkxZPuvPb7Z1DA7Nk", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410757, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and fixed them:\n\n1. **Incorrect Operation in `make_sort()`**: The lambda function incorrectly used the bitwise OR operator `|` instead of addition `+`.\n2. **Incorrect Negation in `make_sort_freq()`**: The histogram was negated using scalar multiplication, which isn't supported.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ comparison and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it's counting how many times each token appears by checking equality across all tokens. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is then created by selecting where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each position, it counts how many keys are smaller. So when we select where target_pos equals indices, it should pick the correct positions. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this correctly sorts the values. Maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. The issue might be in how the keys are being modified. The lambda function is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Wait, in Python, | is a bitwise OR, not addition. Oh, that's a mistake. It should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len? Or perhaps x + (min_key * i) without the OR. Using | here is incorrect because it's not adding, it's doing a bitwise operation which could lead to unexpected results, especially with non-integer values. So that line needs to be fixed.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. The problem is that when multiple tokens have the same frequency, their order isn't preserved. But the function is supposed to maintain the input order for ties. However, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * index, which might not preserve the original order. Wait, but in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram, and then in make_sort, the keys are further modified. This could cause issues because the sorting might not correctly handle the original positions for tie-breaking. Alternatively, perhaps the way the keys are adjusted in make_sort() isn't correctly ensuring uniqueness without disrupting the sorting order.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated so that higher frequencies come first. Then, when sorted, the tokens are arranged from most frequent to least. But when frequencies are the same, the original order should be maintained. However, the current approach in make_sort() might not handle this correctly because it's adding min_key * index, which could change the sorting key in a way that doesn't preserve the original order for equal frequencies.\n\nSo, the main issues I see are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the lambda function uses | instead of +, which is incorrect.\n2. The way keys are modified in make_sort() might not correctly handle tie-breaking for equal keys, especially in make_sort_freq.\n\nLet me address the first issue. The line in make_sort() should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but the original code uses |, which is wrong. So replacing | with +. But also, the scaling by max_seq_len might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to add a small value to each key based on its position to ensure uniqueness without significantly affecting the sort order. For example, x + min_key * i / max_seq_len would add a tiny value, ensuring that each key is unique while maintaining the overall order.\n\nWait, but in the original RASP paper, they might have used a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to add min_key * i, not divided by max_seq_len. Because if max_seq_len is the maximum sequence length, then for each position i, adding min_key * i would ensure that each key is unique, as each i is unique. So the lambda should be x + min_key * i.\n\nSo the corrected line would be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nThat makes more sense. So the mistake was using | instead of +.\n\nNow, for the second issue in make_sort_freq. When frequencies are the same, the original order should be preserved. But the current make_sort() function might not handle this because it's modifying the keys in a way that could disrupt the original order. To fix this, perhaps the tie-breaker should be the original indices. So when two keys are equal, the one with the smaller index comes first.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i. So for tokens with the same original key value, their modified keys will be different because i is unique. So when sorted, the order will be based on the modified keys, which include the index. So for equal keys, the one with the smaller index will come first, which preserves the original order. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram. So when two tokens have the same frequency, their hist values are the same, so their keys in make_sort() will be the same. Then, the make_sort() function adds min_key * i to each, ensuring that each key is unique. So when sorted, the tokens with the same frequency will be ordered based on their original positions because i is smaller for earlier tokens. So the function should correctly maintain the order for ties.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort(), correcting the lambda function.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, so that when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent comes first. Wait, no. Because make_sort() sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if hist is negated, higher frequencies become more negative, so they would appear earlier when sorted. So that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose hist is [2,1,2,1] for input [2,4,2,1]. Then negated hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order, the keys would be -2, -2, -1, -1. But wait, no: the keys are the hist values, which are negated. So the make_sort() function sorts the tokens based on these keys. So the tokens with smaller keys (more negative) come first. So in the example, the tokens with hist -2 (positions 0 and 2) will come before those with -1 (positions 1 and 3). But within the same key, the indices are used to break ties. So token 0 comes before token 2 because 0 < 2. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo the main issue is the incorrect use of | in make_sort(). Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nSo, to summarize, the changes needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), correct the lambda function in SequenceMap to use + instead of |.\n2. Ensure that the lambda function adds min_key * i without division by max_seq_len, as the division was not present in the original code and using | was the mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code had:\n\nx + min_key * i | max_seq_len\n\nBut | is bitwise OR, which is incorrect. So replacing | with +, but what about the max_seq_len? Oh, wait, perhaps the intended operation was addition, not OR. So the correct line should be:\n\nx + (min_key * i) \n\nBut in the original code, it's written as x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, which is x + (min_key * i | max_seq_len), which is not correct. So the correct approach is to remove the | and just add.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_sort() is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nThat should fix the issue.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is multiplied by -1. But in RASP, multiplying by a scalar can be done using rasp.Map. So the line:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nis correct because it's equivalent to rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).\n\nWait, no. In the code, it's written as hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), but in RASP, you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar directly. Instead, you need to use rasp.Map. So this line is incorrect and will cause an error. So I need to fix that.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nSo that's another issue. The original code tries to multiply by -1, which isn't allowed. So that line needs to be changed.\n\nSo now, the two main fixes are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), correct the lambda to use + instead of |.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), fix the negation of hist by using rasp.Map.\n\nLet me go through each function again.\n\nmake_hist() seems correct.\n\nmake_sort_unique() seems correct.\n\nmake_sort() has the lambda issue.\n\nmake_sort_freq() has the negation issue.\n\nSo, the final steps are:\n\n- Fix the lambda in make_sort().\n- Fix the negation in make_sort_freq().\n\nSo, the corrected code will have these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2894, "total_tokens": 7513}}, {"id": "gen-1738410872-zvBc1PYCvuFnAAbpuP2h", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410872, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified and fixed two main issues in the `make_sort` function.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target positions using `SelectorWidth`. The 'sel_new' selector is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Hmm, wait. The `Aggregate` function is supposed to average the selected values, but in this case, we want to select exactly one value per position. So using `Aggregate` without a default might cause issues if no elements are selected. But since the keys are unique, each row should have exactly one True, so it should work. I think this function is okay.\n\nNow, looking at `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. The function modifies the keys by adding `min_key * i | max_seq_len`. Wait, in Python, the | operator is a bitwise OR, not addition. Oh, that's a mistake. It should be using + instead. So the line should be `x + min_key * i`. That's a bug because using | would not correctly adjust the keys to be unique.\n\nAlso, in the same function, the keys are being transformed, but the way it's written might not correctly handle the indices. Let me check: `rasp.SequenceMap` applies a function to each pair of elements from `keys` and `rasp.indices`. So for each position i, the key is x + min_key * i. That makes sense to ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo the main issue is the | instead of +. I'll need to correct that.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls `make_sort` with `hist` as the keys. Wait, the parameters in the call are `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)`. But looking at the definition of `make_sort`, the first two parameters are `vals` and `keys`, and then the keyword arguments. So the function call is correct.\n\nWait, but in `make_sort`, the function is defined with `keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...)`. Oh, no, the function's first line is `keys = ...`, which shadows the parameter `keys`. That's a problem because it reassigns the parameter to a new value. Instead, it should compute a new variable, say `unique_keys`, and then call `make_sort_unique` with `unique_keys`.\n\nSo in `make_sort`, the code should compute `unique_keys` and then return `make_sort_unique(vals, unique_keys)`.\n\nPutting it all together, the issues are:\n\n1. In `make_sort`, the line `keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...)` should instead assign to a new variable, like `unique_keys`, to avoid shadowing the parameter.\n\n2. In the same line, the use of `|` is incorrect; it should be `+`.\n\nLet me outline the corrections:\n\n- In `make_sort`, change the `keys` assignment to `unique_keys`.\n- Replace `|` with `+` in the `SequenceMap` function.\n\nSo the corrected `make_sort` function would look like:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\"\"\"\n    unique_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, unique_keys)\n\nWait, but in the original code, the `make_sort` function's `keys` parameter is being reassigned. That's a mistake because it should use the original `keys` and compute a new set of unique keys. So yes, renaming the variable is necessary.\n\nAnother thing to check: in `make_sort_freq`, the `hist` is negated to sort in ascending order of frequency. That makes sense because lower histogram counts come first.\n\nSo the main corrections are in `make_sort`: fixing the bitwise OR to addition and not shadowing the `keys` parameter.\n\nI think that's all.

Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. So target_pos should give the position where each element should be placed in a sorted list. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals based on that selector. This should correctly sort the values based on the keys. However, the example shows that when keys are [2,4,3,1], the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * index to each key. Wait, the lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Oh, wait, in Python, | is a bitwise OR operator, not a logical OR. That's a problem. It should probably be adding, not doing a bitwise OR. So this line is incorrect. Instead of x + (min_key * i), it's doing x | max_seq_len, which doesn't make sense. That's a bug.\n\nSo the correct line should be something like x + min_key * i. Also, the variables might be mixed up. The parameters are max_seq_len and min_key. So the lambda should take x (the key) and i (the index), then compute x + min_key * i. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a unique offset based on their position.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort to sort based on these negative frequencies. Wait, but when you negate the histogram, lower frequencies come first. So when sorted in ascending order, tokens with higher frequency (more negative) would come first. But the example given is [2,4,2,1], which has hist [2,1,2,1]. Negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted, the order would be based on these keys. The example expects [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the sorting is done correctly. But I'm not sure if the negation is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the keys should be the histogram without negation, and then sorted in ascending order. Or maybe the make_sort function is expecting keys to be in a certain order. Let me think: make_sort() sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if the keys are the histogram counts, higher counts should come first. To achieve that, negating the counts would make them sort in descending order when using a standard ascending sort. So the current approach is correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, so when passed to make_sort, which sorts by ascending order, the tokens with higher original counts (more negative after negation) will come first. So that's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the lambda incorrectly uses | instead of +. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the parameters are max_seq_len and min_key. The lambda should use min_key multiplied by the index (i) and added to x. So the correct line is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. That's wrong. So I'll replace the | with +, and remove the max_seq_len part because it's not needed. The addition of min_key * i ensures uniqueness without needing to OR with max_seq_len.\n\nWait, but the original code might have intended to add min_key * i and then perhaps add max_seq_len as a offset. But that's unclear. The main point is to make each key unique by adding a value based on their position. So the correct approach is to add min_key * i to x.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function should have the SequenceMap with the correct lambda.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\nIn make_sort(), the line:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nshould be changed to:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that all functions are properly using the RASP operations and that there are no other syntax errors.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is created by make_hist(), which returns an SOp. Then it's negated with -1 multiplied. But in RASP, how is this done? Because you can't just multiply by -1 directly. You need to use rasp.Map. So the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect. Instead, it should be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist())\n\nSo that's another bug. The current code tries to multiply by -1, which isn't valid in RASP. So I need to fix that.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nshould be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nPutting it all together, the two main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the lambda incorrectly uses | instead of +.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the negation is done incorrectly; it should use rasp.Map.\n\nLet me correct these.\n\nSo the final code will have:\n\n- make_sort() corrected to use x + min_key * i.\n- make_sort_freq() corrected to use rasp.Map for negation.\n\nI'll also check if other functions have issues. For example, in make_sort_unique(), the sel_new is created with rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Then Aggregate is used to select the vals. That seems correct.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the parameters are max_seq_len and min_key. The min_key is used as a multiplier for the index. So it's important that min_key is a non-zero value to ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo, to recap, the changes are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), fix the lambda in SequenceMap.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), fix the negation using rasp.Map.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2244, "total_tokens": 6863}}, {"id": "gen-1738410990-nJudGel3dQ2z5n5Bsr4O", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410990, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was the incorrect use of a bitwise OR operator in the `make_sort` function.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each key's position is based on how many are smaller. So sel_new would select the correct positions. Then Aggregate should pick the correct vals. Hmm, but in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is sorted. So maybe this works, but I'm not sure if it's handling all cases correctly. Maybe the issue is elsewhere.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * index. Then calls make_sort_unique. But in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). Wait, in the example usage, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), but the function definition only takes four parameters. Oh wait, no, the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp: So the example usage is correct. But in the code, when it calls make_sort_unique, it's passing the modified keys. That seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first because their negative hist is smaller. But wait, when you sort by the negative histogram, it's actually sorting in ascending order of the negative frequency, which would be descending order of frequency. So tokens with higher frequency should come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the histogram is [2,1,1,1], so negated it's [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the keys. The first token (2) has key -2, the second (4) has -1, the third (2) has -2, and the fourth (1) has -1. So when sorted, the order would be the two -2's first, then the -1's. So the sorted tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So why is the function not working as expected?\n\nWait, looking at make_sort_freq(), the function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't match because the function expects only max_seq_len. Oh, that's a problem. The function signature is incorrect. It should take max_seq_len as a parameter, but in the example, it's being passed tokens and tokens as well. So that's a mistake. The function should probably take the tokens as part of the SOp, but in the current code, it's not. So the make_sort_freq function is incorrectly defined.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the function make_sort_freq is supposed to return an SOp that can be called with a sequence. So the function should create an SOp that, when called, processes the input. So inside make_sort_freq, it's using rasp.tokens, which is the input. So the function doesn't need to take tokens as an argument. But in the example usage, the user is trying to pass tokens, which is incorrect. So the function definition is correct, but the example usage is wrong. However, the user's code is the one that's broken, so I need to fix the function.\n\nWait, no. The function make_sort_freq is supposed to return an SOp that, when called with a sequence, returns the sorted tokens based on frequency. So the function doesn't need to take any SOps as parameters because it's using rasp.tokens internally. So the function signature is correct as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, the user is calling it with make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which is incorrect. So the function is correct, but the example is wrong. However, the user's task is to repair the program, so perhaps the function is intended to be called without those arguments. Alternatively, maybe the function should take the tokens and keys, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nSo in this code, make_sort is called with rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. So the function make_sort_freq is creating an SOp that, when evaluated, will sort the tokens based on their frequency. So the function is correct as is. But perhaps the issue is that in the example usage, the function is being called incorrectly. But the user's task is to repair the program, not the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is in the make_sort function. Let me check the parameters. The make_sort function is defined with max_seq_len and min_key, which are used to modify the keys to make them unique. But in make_sort_freq, when it calls make_sort, it's passing max_seq_len and min_key=1. So the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. But in the case of hist, which is -1 * frequency, adding min_key * index could cause issues because the hist might not be unique even after adding. But I'm not sure if that's the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the make_sort_unique function. Let me think about how it works. It creates a 'smaller' selector where each row i has True for all j where keys[j] < keys[i]. Then target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new is a selector where each row i selects the position where target_pos equals the index. So for each i, it's looking for the position where the count of smaller keys is equal to i. Then Aggregate picks the vals at those positions.\n\nWait, but in the case where multiple keys have the same value, this approach might not work correctly. For example, if two keys are equal, their target_pos would be the same, and sel_new would select the same position for both, leading to only one of them being selected. But in make_sort_unique, the function is intended for unique keys, so that's why it's called make_sort_unique. So perhaps the issue is that in make_sort, when the keys are modified to be unique, but the way it's done might not be correct.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the code is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, the lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. Wait, that's a bitwise OR, which is probably incorrect. It should be addition, not OR. Oh, that's a mistake. The | operator is a bitwise OR, which would not correctly add the min_key * i to x. So this line is wrong. It should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len? Or perhaps x + (min_key * i) without the OR.\n\nWait, the original intention is to add a small value to each key to make them unique. So for each position i, the key is x + min_key * i. But in the code, it's written as x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, which is a bitwise OR. That's definitely incorrect. It should be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len or something similar to ensure that each key is unique by adding a small increment based on position.\n\nSo the mistake is using | instead of +. So the line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code was intended to add min_key multiplied by i, scaled by max_seq_len to avoid overlapping. So the correct code would replace the | with +.\n\nSo that's one issue: the bitwise OR instead of addition.\n\nAnother possible issue is in make_sort_freq(). It's using make_sort with hist as keys, but hist is the negative frequency. So when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the frequencies are 2 for 2, 1 for 4, 1 for 1. So hist is [2,1,1,1], negated to [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order is based on the keys. The two -2's come first, then the -1's. So the sorted tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So the function should work if the keys are correctly modified.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, the key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique because each position adds a small value. So when sorting, the order is determined first by x, then by the added value, which ensures stability.\n\nSo the main issue is the | instead of + in the make_sort function. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the make_sort_unique function. Let's test it with an example. Suppose keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector would be:\n\nFor each i, j where keys[j] < keys[i].\n\ni=0 (key=2): j=3 (key=1) \u2192 True. So row 0 has one True.\ni=1 (key=4): j=0,2,3 \u2192 three Trues.\ni=2 (key=3): j=0,3 \u2192 two Trues.\ni=3 (key=1): no j \u2192 zero Trues.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is a selector where each row i selects the position where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, it looks for j where target_pos[j] ==0 \u2192 j=3. So row 0 selects position 3. For i=1, it looks for j where target_pos[j]==1 \u2192 j=0. For i=2, j=2. For i=3, j=1. So the selector would select positions [3,0,2,1]. Then Aggregate would pick vals[3], vals[0], vals[2], vals[1], which for [2,4,3,1] would be [1,2,3,4]. That works.\n\nBut what if the keys are not unique? Well, make_sort_unique is intended for unique keys, so that's why make_sort is used when keys might not be unique.\n\nSo the main issue is the | in make_sort. Let me correct that.\n\nSo in the make_sort function, the line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. So I need to replace | with +, and perhaps adjust the scaling.\n\nWait, the original code's comment says that it's using min_key and max_seq_len to ensure keys are unique. So perhaps the correct approach is to add a small value to each key based on its position. For example, for each position i, add min_key * i / max_seq_len. This way, each key is incremented by a small amount, ensuring uniqueness without significantly affecting the sorting order.\n\nSo the corrected line would be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the lambda is x + min_key * i | max_seq_len. So perhaps the intended operation was x + (min_key * i) divided by max_seq_len, to scale it down. Alternatively, maybe it's x + min_key * (i / max_seq_len). Either way, the bitwise OR is incorrect.\n\nSo I'll correct that line.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the make_sort_freq function. It's using make_sort with min_key=1. But if the hist is negative, adding min_key * i might not correctly order the tokens. For example, if two tokens have the same frequency, their hist would be the same, and adding min_key * i would make their keys unique, but the sorting would be based on the added value, which is based on position. So tokens with the same frequency would appear in the order of their positions, which is correct according to the example.\n\nSo after correcting the | to +, the functions should work as intended.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort(), correct the bitwise OR to addition and adjust the scaling.\n\n2.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each position, it's counting how many keys are smaller than it. So when we select where target_pos equals indices, for each index i, we pick the key at position i in target_pos. But wait, the indices are 0-based. So for the first element (index 0), target_pos is 3, which doesn't match 0. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no. The 'smaller' selector is keys compared with keys using LT. So for each key, it's looking for all keys that are smaller than it. The target_pos is the count of such keys for each position. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Because for the first element 2, there's one element smaller (1). For 4, three elements are smaller. For 3, two. For 1, none. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). So for each row i, it's checking if target_pos[i] equals the index j. So for i=0, target_pos is 1, so it selects j=1. For i=1, target_pos is 3, selects j=3. For i=2, target_pos is 2, selects j=2. For i=3, target_pos is 0, selects j=0. So the selector is such that each row i has a single True at j = target_pos[i]. Then Aggregate uses this selector to pick vals from the selected positions. So for each i, it takes vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. So the output should be [vals[1], vals[3], vals[2], vals[0]], which for [2,4,3,1] would be [4,1,3,2]. Wait, that's not the expected output. The example says it should return [1,2,3,4]. Hmm, that suggests that the current implementation isn't correct. So maybe the logic in make_sort_unique is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the Aggregate function works. The Aggregate function takes a selector and an SOp, and for each row, it averages the selected elements. But in this case, each row has exactly one True, so it's selecting one element. So for each i, the output is vals[j] where j is the position where target_pos[i] equals j. So in the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for i=0, j=1: vals[1] is 4. For i=1, j=3: vals[3] is 1. For i=2, j=2: vals[2] is 3. For i=3, j=0: vals[0] is 2. So the output would be [4,1,3,2], which is not sorted. So the function isn't working as intended. That's a problem.\n\nSo the issue is in make_sort_unique. It's not correctly sorting the values. The approach in the RASP paper might have a different method. Alternatively, perhaps the way the selector is built is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the 'smaller' selector is built as keys compared to keys using LT, which gives a matrix where smaller[i,j] is True if keys[j] < keys[i]. Then target_pos[i] is the number of keys smaller than keys[i], which is the count of Trues in row i. So target_pos is the rank of each key, but starting from 0. So to get the position where each element should go, perhaps we need to create a selector that for each i, selects the j where target_pos[j] == i. Because that would mean that the j-th element is the i-th smallest.\n\nSo instead of sel_new = Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), which selects for each i, j where target_pos[i] == j, perhaps we need to transpose that. Because for each j, if target_pos[j] == i, then j is the position of the i-th smallest element.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose we have keys [2,4,3,1]. The target_pos for each element is [1,3,2,0]. So the smallest element is 1 at position 3, which has target_pos 0. The next is 2 at position 0, target_pos 1. Then 3 at position 2, target_pos 2. Then 4 at position 1, target_pos 3.\n\nSo the desired output is [1,2,3,4], which corresponds to the elements at positions 3,0,2,1.\n\nSo for each i in 0..3, we need to select the element at position j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo the selector should be such that for row i, column j is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo how to create that selector.\n\nIn the current code, sel_new is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). So for each i, it's checking if target_pos[i] == j (since rasp.indices is j). So row i has True at j = target_pos[i]. So when we aggregate, for each i, we take vals[target_pos[i]].\n\nBut that's not what we want. We want for each i, to take the vals[j] where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo perhaps the selector should be built as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each row j, we check if indices[j] == target_pos[i] for each i. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the Select function takes keys, queries, and a predicate. So for each key in keys and query in queries, it applies the predicate. So if we have keys as rasp.indices (which is [0,1,2,3]) and queries as target_pos (which is [1,3,2,0]), then for each i, j, the predicate is keys[i] == queries[j]. So the selector will have True where i == target_pos[j]. So row j will have True at i = target_pos[j]. So when we aggregate, for each j, we take the value from i = target_pos[j]. But that's the same as the current approach, which isn't giving the correct result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the rows and columns mixed up. The selector is a matrix where each row corresponds to a key, and each column to a query. So in the current setup, for each key i, the row i has True at columns j where target_pos[i] == j. So when we aggregate, each row i will take the value from column j where j is target_pos[i]. So the output for i is vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. But in the example, that gives [4,1,3,2], which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the current selector is selecting the wrong positions. Instead, we need a selector where for each i, the row i has True at j where target_pos[j] == i. Because then, when we aggregate, each row i will collect the vals[j] where j is such that target_pos[j] == i, which is exactly the j-th element's target position is i, meaning it's the i-th smallest element.\n\nSo how to create such a selector. We can create a selector where for each j, we check if target_pos[j] == i, for each i. So the keys would be target_pos, and the queries would be rasp.indices. So the selector is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Wait, no. Because Select(keys, queries, predicate) applies the predicate to each key and query. So if keys are target_pos (which is a vector) and queries are rasp.indices (another vector), then for each element in keys (which is target_pos[j] for j in 0..n-1) and each query (i), the predicate is target_pos[j] == i. So the selector will have rows corresponding to j, and columns i. So row j has True at column i where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, but in RASP, the Select function returns a selector where each row corresponds to a key, and each column to a query. So if keys are target_pos (shape (n,)), and queries are indices (shape (n,)), then the selector will be an n x n matrix where selector[j,i] is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo when we use this selector in Aggregate, for each row j, it will aggregate the vals[i] where selector[j,i] is True. But in our case, each row j has exactly one True, at i = target_pos[j]. So the aggregate for row j would be vals[i] where i = target_pos[j]. But that's the same as before, leading to the same incorrect result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what the correct selector should look like. For the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. The correct sorted order is [1,2,3,4], which are the values at positions 3,0,2,1.\n\nSo for each position in the output (i), we need to select the value from position j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=3 (since target_pos[3]=0). For i=1, j=0 (target_pos[0]=1). For i=2, j=2. For i=3, j=1.\n\nSo the selector should be such that for row i, the True is at column j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector is a matrix where selector[i,j] is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nTo create this, the keys should be rasp.indices (i) and the queries should be target_pos (j). So the Select function would be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each i (key) and j (query), it checks if i == target_pos[j]. So row i will have True at column j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo in the code, instead of sel_new = Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), it should be sel_new = Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). That way, each row i selects the j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nLet me test this with the example. For keys [2,4,3,1], target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So the selector will be:\n\nFor i=0: j=3 (since target_pos[3]=0) \u2192 True at j=3.\nFor i=1: j=0 \u2192 True at j=0.\nFor i=2: j=2 \u2192 True at j=2.\nFor i=3: j=1 \u2192 True at j=1.\n\nSo the selector matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [False, False, False, True]\nRow 1: [True, False, False, False]\nRow 2: [False, False, True, False]\nRow 3: [False, True, False, False]\n\nWhen we aggregate vals using this selector, each row i will take vals[j] where j is the position where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=3 \u2192 vals[3]=1. For i=1, j=0 \u2192 vals[0]=2. For i=2, j=2 \u2192 vals[2]=3. For i=3, j=1 \u2192 vals[1]=4. So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the fix is to change the Select in make_sort_unique to use rasp.indices as keys and target_pos as queries.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i | max_seq_len. Wait, the code says:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i | max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. The lambda is x + (min_key * i) | max_seq_len. But | is a bitwise OR, which might not be intended here. Maybe it's a typo and should be something else, like multiplication or addition. Or perhaps it's meant to be x + min_key * i, and then somehow scaled by max_seq_len. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be x + (min_key * i) / max_seq_len, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, the comment says it's to ensure keys are unique by adding min_key * i. So perhaps the correct expression is x + min_key * i. But in the code, it's x + (min_key * i) | max_seq_len. That would add the bitwise OR of (min_key * i) and max_seq_len to x, which doesn't make sense. So this is likely a bug.\n\nSo the correct code should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut wait, the original code uses | max_seq_len. That's probably incorrect. So I need to fix that.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nThis way, each key is adjusted by min_key multiplied by its index, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes hist as -1 * make_hist(). Then passes hist to make_sort. But hist is a sequence where each element is the count of that token. So when we sort by hist, it should arrange tokens by their frequency. However, since hist is negated, the sorting will be in ascending order of hist, which is descending order of frequency. So the most frequent tokens come first.\n\nWait, in the example given, hist for [2,4,2,1] is [2,1,2,1]. So negated hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the tokens with higher frequency (more negative) come first. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, make_sort_freq() returns make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1). So hist is the negative of the histogram. So the keys for sorting are the negative histogram values. So when sorted in ascending order, tokens with higher frequency (more negative) come first.\n\nBut in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i. So with min_key=1, each key is adjusted by i. So for the example, the keys would be:\n\nOriginal hist: [2,1,2,1] \u2192 negated: [-2,-1,-2,-1]\n\nAfter adding i (0,1,2,3):\n\n-2 + 0 = -2\n\n-1 + 1 = 0\n\n-2 + 2 = 0\n\n-1 + 3 = 2\n\nSo the adjusted keys are [-2, 0, 0, 2]. But wait, this might not ensure uniqueness because two keys are 0. So when sorted, their order isn't determined by their original positions, which could cause instability.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, make_sort() is supposed to handle non-unique keys by using max_seq_len and min_key to make them unique. So perhaps the adjustment is correct, but the lambda in make_sort() was wrong.\n\nSo the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the selector is incorrectly built, leading to incorrect sorting. Fix by changing the Select to use rasp.indices as keys and target_pos as queries.\n\n2. In make_sort(), the lambda incorrectly uses | max_seq_len. It should be x + min_key * i.\n\n3. Additionally, in make_sort_freq(), when creating hist, it's multiplied by -1. But the example expects the tokens to be sorted by frequency, so higher frequency first. So the negation is correct because when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies (more negative) come first.\n\nSo the steps to fix are:\n\n- In make_sort_unique(), change sel_new to Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\n- In make_sort(), fix the lambda to x + min_key * i.\n\nNow, let me check if there are other issues.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(), it uses make_sort with hist as keys. But hist is a sequence of counts, and after negation, it's used as the key. So the sorting should be correct after the fixes.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in make_sort(), the keys are being modified, but the function is supposed to sort the vals based on the keys. So after adjusting the keys to be unique, the sorting should work correctly.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected functions would have the following changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), change the Select to use rasp.indices and target_pos correctly.\n\n2. In make_sort(), fix the lambda in SequenceMap.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 4697, "total_tokens": 9316}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
