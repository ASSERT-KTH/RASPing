Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, right? So maybe it should be EQ instead of LEQ. Because if we're selecting where tokens are equal, that makes sense for counting. So same_tok should be created with Comparison.EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then gets target_pos as SelectorWidth of smaller. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. Finally, it aggregates sel_new with vals. That seems correct because it's selecting the position where the count is equal to the current index, which would give the sorted order. But wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the smaller selector would have each row indicating how many keys are less than the current key. So target_pos would be the number of keys less than each key, which is the correct position in the sorted array. So that part seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the function signature in the original code is incorrect. The parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, when make_sort is called, it's passed (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function definition should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments. But in the current code, the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp: which is correct.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the original code's make_sort function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which would pass 5 and 1 as positional arguments after keys. But since max_seq_len and min_key are keyword-only, this would cause an error. So the function definition should have default values or be adjusted. Alternatively, the example usage should pass them as keyword arguments. But the function requires them as keyword-only, so the example is incorrect. Wait, no, in Python, when you define parameters after * as keyword-only, you can't pass them positionally. So in the example, the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1). But the user's example shows it being called with positional arguments, which would cause a TypeError. So the function definition is incorrect. It should either not have the * or make the parameters optional with defaults.\n\nBut looking at the original code, the function is defined with * and no default values, which would require the caller to pass them as keyword arguments. So the example usage is wrong. But the user's task is to repair the program, so perhaps the function definition should be adjusted to have default values. Alternatively, the example is incorrect, but the function is correct. Hmm, but the user provided the code, so perhaps the function is wrong.\n\nWait, the original code's make_sort function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nWhich means that max_seq_len and min_key must be passed as keyword arguments. So in the example, the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, max_seq_len=5, min_key=1). But in the user's example, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which is incorrect and would cause a TypeError. So the function definition is incorrect because it's expecting keyword-only arguments without default values, making it impossible to call it with positional arguments. Therefore, to fix this, the function should either have default values for max_seq_len and min_key or not be keyword-only. Alternatively, the example should be corrected, but since the task is to repair the program, I'll adjust the function to have default values.\n\nWait, but the function's purpose is to require max_seq_len and min_key, so perhaps they shouldn't have defaults. Alternatively, the function can be adjusted to accept them as positional or keyword. So perhaps the function should not have the * and just have the parameters as positional. So the function definition should be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut then the example usage would be correct as it's passing them positionally. So that's a possible fix.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram as hist = -1 * make_hist(). Then uses make_sort with vals as tokens and keys as hist. Wait, but in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the tokens are sorted by their frequency. So tokens with higher frequency come first. But in the code, hist is negative, so when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies (more negative) come first. Wait, no. Because make_sort() sorts by the keys in ascending order. So if hist is negative, higher frequency (which is a larger number) becomes more negative, so when sorted, they would come earlier. So that's correct.\n\nWait, let's see: make_hist() returns the count of each token. So for [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1]. Then hist is multiplied by -1, so keys become [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then make_sort is called with keys=hist. So the sorting is based on these negative counts. So the tokens will be sorted in the order of their keys from smallest to largest. So the most negative (highest frequency) comes first. So in the example, the tokens 2 and 2 (with key -2) come before 4 (key -1) and 1 (key -1). So the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, a small value is added to the key to ensure uniqueness. This way, when multiple tokens have the same key value, their order is determined by their position, ensuring stability. So that part seems correct.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if max_seq_len is zero? That would cause division by zero. But the function is called with max_seq_len as a parameter, which is supposed to be the maximum sequence length, so it's likely to be at least 1. So that's probably okay.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort() function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each token, its key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len, where i is the position index. This ensures that each key is unique because each i is unique. So when sorting, the primary key is x, and the secondary key is i, ensuring that tokens with the same x are ordered by their position. That makes sense.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_unique(), when creating sel_new, it's using rasp.Select with target_pos and rasp.indices, comparison EQ. So for each position in target_pos, it's selecting the index where the target_pos equals the index. So for each row i in target_pos, it's looking for the index j where target_pos[i] == j. Then, when aggregating, it's taking the value from vals at that position. That correctly reconstructs the sorted array.\n\nWait, but in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3,3,3,0] (since each key's value is the number of keys less than it). So for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than keys[i]. So for the first element (2), there are 1 key (1) less than it, so target_pos[0] is 1. Wait, no, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, for keys = [2,4,3,1], the smaller selector is created with keys compared with LT. So for each i, smaller[i] is a selector where each entry j is True if keys[j] < keys[i]. So for i=0 (key=2), the number of j where keys[j] < 2 is 1 (only the last element, 1). So target_pos[0] is 1. For i=1 (key=4), all other keys (2,3,1) are less than 4, so target_pos[1] is 3. For i=2 (key=3), keys less than 3 are 2 and 1, so target_pos[2] is 2. For i=3 (key=1), no keys are less than 1, so target_pos[3] is 0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then, sel_new is a selector where for each i, it's True at position j where target_pos[i] == j. So for each i, it selects the j where j equals target_pos[i]. So when we aggregate, for each i, we take vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. So the output would be [vals[1], vals[3], vals[2], vals[0]] which is [4,1,3,2]. Wait, that's not the sorted order. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The make_sort_unique function is supposed to return vals sorted by keys. So in the example, keys are [2,4,3,1], so the sorted order of keys is [1,2,3,4], and the corresponding vals (assuming vals are the same as keys) would be [1,2,3,4]. But according to the target_pos, it's [1,3,2,0]. So when we aggregate, for each i, we pick vals[target_pos[i]]. So for i=0, target_pos[0]=1, so we take vals[1]=4. For i=1, target_pos[1]=3, take vals[3]=1. For i=2, target_pos[2]=2, take vals[2]=3. For i=3, target_pos[3]=0, take vals[0]=2. So the output would be [4,1,3,2], which is not sorted. That's incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the make_sort_unique function isn't working as intended. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I see the issue. The target_pos is the number of keys less than the current key, which is the position where the current key should be placed in the sorted array. But when we create sel_new as Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), it's selecting for each i, the j where target_pos[i] == j. Then, when we aggregate, for each i, we take vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. So the output at position i is vals[target_pos[i]]. But that's not the correct way to build the sorted array.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about how the aggregation works. The selector sel_new is a matrix where for each row i, the column j is True if target_pos[i] == j. So when we aggregate, for each row i, we're summing the vals[j] where sel_new[i][j] is True, which is just vals[j] where j = target_pos[i], and then since it's an aggregate without a default, it would return that value. So the output is [vals[target_pos[0]], vals[target_pos[1]], ...].\n\nBut in the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0], so the output would be [vals[1], vals[3], vals[2], vals[0]] which is [4,1,3,2]. That's not the sorted order. So the function is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the make_sort_unique function, when sort is called on [2,4,3,1], the output is [1,2,3,4]. So how does that happen? Because the code as written doesn't produce that. So there must be a mistake in the make_sort_unique function.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The target_pos is the number of keys less than the current key, which is the correct position in the sorted array. But when creating the selector, we should be selecting for each j, whether j is the correct position for i. So perhaps the selector should be created as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, we want to know if j is the target position for any i.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The aggregation is done over the selector. So for each i in the output, we need to find the j such that when the keys are sorted, the j-th key is the one that should be at position i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selector should be constructed as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. Then, when we aggregate, for each i, we take the vals[j] where target_pos[j] == i. That would correctly place each val at its sorted position.\n\nSo in the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for i=0, we look for j where target_pos[j] == 0, which is j=3. So vals[3] is 1. For i=1, j where target_pos[j]==1 is j=0, so vals[0]=2. For i=2, j=2, vals[2]=3. For i=3, j=1, vals[1]=4. So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the mistake in make_sort_unique is that sel_new is created as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), which is checking for target_pos[i] == j. But we need to check for j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ), not the other way around.\n\nSo the correct code should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBecause for each j, we want to see if target_pos[j] equals i, the current output position.\n\nSo that's the main issue. The make_sort_unique function is incorrectly creating the selector, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nAnother issue is in make_sort_freq(). It uses make_sort with hist as the key, but hist is the negative of the histogram. However, in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So when the hist is negative, adding a positive value (since min_key is 1 and i starts from 0) would make the keys more unique, but the sorting would still be based on the original key plus this small value. That should be okay.\n\nSo to fix the code:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the comparison from LEQ to EQ.\n\n2. In make_sort_unique(), change the Select to use rasp.indices as the first argument and target_pos as the second, with EQ comparison.\n\n3. In make_sort(), fix the function parameters to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments, possibly by removing the * and adding default values if necessary.\n\nWait, but the function make_sort() is called in make_sort_freq() with max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. So perhaps the function should have default values. Alternatively, the function can be adjusted to have max_seq_len and min_key as optional parameters with default values, but the original code doesn't provide them. So to avoid breaking the function calls, perhaps the function should have default values, like max_seq_len=1 and min_key=0, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, the function can be adjusted to not require keyword-only arguments.\n\nWait, in the original code, the function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nWhich requires max_seq_len and min_key to be passed as keyword arguments. But in the example, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which is incorrect. So to fix this, the function should either have default values or not be keyword-only.\n\nSo perhaps the function should be redefined as:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut then, in the example, the call would be correct. Alternatively, if we want to keep them as keyword-only, the example should be adjusted, but since the task is to repair the program, I'll adjust the function to accept them as positional.\n\nSo putting it all together, the changes needed are:\n\n- make_hist(): Change Select comparison to EQ.\n\n- make_sort_unique(): Change Select to use rasp.indices and target_pos with EQ.\n\n- make_sort(): Adjust function parameters to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, ensure that the operation is correct.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the code is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nBut rasp.indices returns the position indices, starting from 0. So for each token, its key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This adds a small value to each key based on its position, ensuring that keys are unique even if the original keys have duplicates. That should be correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the function is named as 'sort' but in the code, it's named as 'sort_unique' and 'sort_freq'. But that's just naming, not a functional issue.\n\nSo the final steps are:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the Select comparison to EQ.\n\n2. In make_sort_unique(), change the Select to use rasp.indices and target_pos with EQ.\n\n3. In make_sort(), adjust the function parameters to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort function is called in make_sort_freq() as:\n\nmake_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nWhich passes them as keyword arguments. So if the function is adjusted to accept them as positional, the call would need to change. Alternatively, the function can have default values, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, the function can be adjusted to accept both positional and keyword arguments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should have default values for max_seq_len and min_key, but that might not be suitable as they are required parameters.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to remove the * in the function definition, allowing max_seq_len and min_key to be passed as positional or keyword arguments. So the function would be:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nThis way, the example can be called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), and the call in make_sort_freq() can still pass them as keyword arguments.\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, let me outline the changes:\n\n- make_hist(): Change Select to use EQ.\n\n- make_sort_unique(): Change Select to use rasp.indices and target_pos with EQ.\n\n- make_sort(): Remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key positional parameters.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort(), the keys are being reassigned. The original code does:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(...)\n\nBut the function parameter is also named keys. So this would overwrite the parameter. It's better to use a different variable name, like modified_keys.\n\nSo in make_sort(), after computing modified_keys, return make_sort_unique(vals, modified_keys).\n\nPutting it all together, the corrected functions would be:\n\nFor make_hist():\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nFor make_sort_unique():\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nFor make_sort():\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n    modified_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, modified_keys)\n\nAnd make_sort_freq() remains the same, but now when it calls make_sort(), it passes the parameters correctly.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), the call is:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nBut with the adjusted make_sort(), which now takes max_seq_len and min_key as positional, this would cause an error because it's passing them as keyword arguments. So to fix this, the call should be:\n\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1)\n\nAlternatively, adjust the function to accept keyword arguments. Hmm, perhaps it's better to keep the function as keyword-only to enforce explicit parameter passing. So perhaps the function should have the * and require keyword arguments, and the example should be adjusted.\n\nWait, but the user's example shows the function being called with positional arguments, which would fail if the function requires keyword-only. So perhaps the function should not have the * and accept positional arguments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can have default values, but that's not suitable as max_seq_len and min_key are required.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. To resolve this, perhaps the function should be adjusted to accept max_seq_len and min_key as keyword-only arguments, and the example should be corrected. But since the task is to repair the program, perhaps the function should be adjusted to accept them as positional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can have default values, but that's not ideal. For example, setting max_seq_len to a default of 0, but that would cause division by zero. So perhaps it's better to keep the function as keyword-only and adjust the example. But since the user's code is provided, perhaps the function is correct, and the example is wrong. But the task is to repair the program, so perhaps the function should be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can accept both positional and keyword arguments by not using the *.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, not less than or equal. So same_tok should use EQ instead of LEQ. That makes sense because we want to count how many times each token is equal to every other token. So I'll change the predicate to Comparison.EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then target_pos is the SelectorWidth of smaller. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. Finally, it aggregates sel_new with vals. Hmm, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4]. Let me see if the current implementation correctly captures that.\n\nWait, the smaller selector is comparing each key to others. For each position i, it's checking if key[i] < key[j] for all j. The target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each key. So for the first key (2), how many keys are smaller? 1 (only 1). So target_pos for 2 would be 1. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. So for each position i, it's looking for j where target_pos[j] == i. Then it aggregates the vals at those positions. That should correctly sort the values.\n\nBut wait, in the current code, the Aggregate is using sel_new as the selector and vals as the sop. So for each row in sel_new, it's selecting the vals where the selector is True. But since each row in sel_new has exactly one True (because target_pos is unique), it should pick the correct value. So maybe this part is correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified. Let me check the code:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nYes, that's correct. It adds a small value to each key based on its position to break ties.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, hist is the count of each token. So when we negate it, the tokens with higher frequency get lower values, so when sorted in ascending order, they come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see:\n\nThe histogram for [2,4,2,1] is [2,1,2,1]. Negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So the keys are [-2, -1, -2, -1]. Then, when sorted, the order is based on these keys. So the sorted order would be the indices sorted by their keys. The keys are:\n\nindex 0: -2\n\nindex 1: -1\n\nindex 2: -2\n\nindex 3: -1\n\nSo the sorted order should be indices 1,3,0,2. So the output would be [4,1,2,2], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So lower keys come first. So for the keys [-2, -1, -2, -1], the order would be indices 0,2,1,3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So why is the current code not working?\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, hist is computed as the count, then negated. So higher counts become more negative. So when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with higher counts come first. So the code seems correct. But perhaps the issue is that the make_sort function is not correctly handling the modified keys.\n\nWait, in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So each key becomes unique. Then, when sorted, the order is based on these modified keys. So in the make_sort_freq example, the hist is negated, and then the keys are modified. So the sorting should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being overwritten. Oh, wait, the function parameter is 'keys', and then inside, it's assigned to a new value. So the original keys are replaced with the modified ones. That's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Let me check the make_sort_unique function again. It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are less than each key. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. So for each position i, it's looking for the position where target_pos[j] == i. Then it aggregates the vals at those positions.\n\nWait, but in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. So for each i, we select the j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=3; i=1, j=0; i=2, j=2; i=3, j=1. So the aggregated vals would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the Aggregate is using sel_new as the selector and vals as the sop. So for each row in sel_new, it's selecting the vals where the selector is True. Since each row has exactly one True, it picks the correct value. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the make_sort_unique function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). But according to the RASP rules, Aggregate should have a default value of None. In the current code, the default is not specified, so it's None by default. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the code, in make_sort_unique, the return is rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is in the make_hist function. Let me think again. The original code uses LEQ, which is incorrect. It should be EQ. So that's a bug. So I need to change that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, but what if the histogram is zero? Well, in the example, it's not, but in general, it's possible. But the code should handle it.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_sort, the keys are being modified, but what if the min_key is not small enough? Well, the function requires that min_key is such that the added value ensures uniqueness, given max_seq_len. So that's up to the user.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort, the function is named but the parameters are not correctly passed. Let me check the function definition:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nYes, that's correct. And in the example, it's called with make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is incorrect. Let me see:\n\nmake_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nYes, because hist is the negated histogram. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, the key is increased by (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. So for i=0, it's 0; i=1, min_key / max_seq_len; etc. So this ensures that each key is unique.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort_freq function, the keys are the negated histogram. So when we add the position-based value, it's modifying the sorting key correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_unique, the selector is built using target_pos and rasp.indices with EQ. But what if multiple positions have the same target_pos? That would cause sel_new to have multiple Trues in a row, which would cause the Aggregate to average multiple values, which is not intended. But in make_sort_unique, it's assumed that keys are unique, so target_pos should be unique for each position. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos is [1,3,2,0], which are all unique. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the main issue I can see is in make_hist, where the predicate is LEQ instead of EQ. So I need to fix that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort, when the keys are modified, the function uses rasp.SequenceMap with keys and rasp.indices. But in the code, it's written as:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). So when calling make_sort, the keys are passed correctly.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main bug is in make_hist using LEQ instead of EQ. So I'll change that.\n\nLet me go through each function again:\n\n1. make_hist: Change predicate to EQ.\n\n2. make_sort_unique: Seems correct.\n\n3. make_sort: Seems correct.\n\n4. make_sort_freq: Seems correct except for the hist function.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in make_hist.\n\nWait, but looking at the example in make_hist, the output is [2,1,2,1] for input \"abac\". Let's see:\n\nInput is \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\".\n\nThe histogram should be [2,1,2,1]. So same_tok is a selector where each row i is True for all j where token[j] == token[i].\n\nSo for i=0 (a), j=0 and j=2 are True. So count is 2.\n\nFor i=1 (b), only j=1 is True. Count is 1.\n\nFor i=2 (a), same as i=0. Count 2.\n\nFor i=3 (c), only j=3. Count 1.\n\nSo the output is [2,1,2,1], which is correct.\n\nBut with the current code using LEQ, same_tok would include all tokens less than or equal, which is not correct. So changing to EQ fixes it.\n\nSo the only change is in make_hist.\n\nWait, but in the code, same_tok is named(\"same_tok\"), and the return is named(\"hist\"). So the naming is correct.\n\nSo, the final step is to correct the predicate in make_hist from LEQ to EQ.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 3270, "total_tokens": 7889}}, {"id": "gen-1738410669-NFbbG6c1ap9bDfeGuiKK", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410669, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified and fixed two main issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Comparison in `make_hist()`**: The function was using `rasp.Comparison.LEQ` which led to incorrect token counts.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, right? So maybe it should be EQ instead of LEQ. Because if we use LEQ, it might select more elements than intended, leading to incorrect counts. So I'll change that to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then gets target_pos as SelectorWidth. Then creates sel_new with target_pos and indices EQ. Finally, aggregates vals with sel_new. Hmm, but when multiple keys are the same, this might not handle them correctly. Also, the example shows it's supposed to return the values sorted, but I'm not sure if this implementation correctly handles all cases, especially when there are duplicate keys. But since the function is intended for unique keys, maybe it's okay. I'll leave it for now.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the parameters in the function definition are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function signature should have max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. Looking at the code, the function is defined correctly, so that's fine.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It calculates hist as -1 * make_hist(), which inverts the frequencies. Then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, in the example, make_sort_freq is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), but the function definition only takes max_seq_len. Oh, I see, the original code has a mistake in the function parameters. The correct definition should have only max_seq_len as an argument, not vals and keys. So I need to fix the function signature of make_sort_freq. It should probably take max_seq_len and maybe other necessary parameters, but looking at how it's used, it's called without vals and keys, so the function should not have those as parameters. So I'll correct the function to only take max_seq_len.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq(), when calling make_sort, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. That makes sense because we're sorting the tokens based on their frequency. But I need to ensure that the hist is correctly computed. Since hist is the frequency, using it as the key with negative values will sort from lowest to highest frequency. Wait, no, because in make_sort, the keys are being used to determine the order. So using -hist will sort in ascending order of frequency. But I think the intention is to sort from highest to lowest frequency. Hmm, maybe the sign is incorrect. Let me think: if hist is the count, then -hist will make higher counts come first when sorted in ascending order. So the current approach is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. make_hist() uses LEQ instead of EQ.\n2. make_sort_freq() has incorrect function parameters.\n\nSo I'll fix make_hist by changing the comparison to EQ. And I'll correct the function signature of make_sort_freq to only take max_seq_len as a parameter.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other issues. In make_sort(), the keys are being modified correctly to ensure uniqueness, which should handle sorting with non-unique keys. The example given seems to work with that approach.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the original make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated. So when sorting, lower hist (higher frequency) will come first. So the output should be tokens sorted by frequency in descending order. The example given in the comments shows [2,4,2,1] becoming [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, and 1 once. So the sorting is correct.\n\nI think that's all.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, right? So maybe it should be EQ instead of LEQ. Because if we use LEQ, it might select more elements than intended, leading to incorrect counts. So I'll change that to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then gets target_pos as SelectorWidth. Then creates sel_new with target_pos and indices EQ. Finally, aggregates vals with sel_new. Hmm, but when you aggregate, if the selector has multiple trues, it averages. But in this case, each row should have exactly one true because it's unique keys. So maybe it's okay, but perhaps using the correct comparison is important. Wait, in the original code, the selector is smaller, which is keys < keys. That might not be the right approach. Oh, wait, no. The smaller selector is created by comparing each key with others. So for each position i, it counts how many keys are smaller than key i. Then target_pos is the count, which would be the position where the key should be placed. Then sel_new selects the position where target_pos equals the index. So that part seems correct.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. That should make each key unique based on their position, which helps in sorting when there are ties.\n\nThen make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as the key for sorting. But wait, the hist is computed as the count of each token. So when we negate it, tokens with higher frequency get lower keys, so they appear earlier. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1]. The histogram is [2,1,1,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the tokens with higher frequency come first. But the example shows that 2 comes first because it's more frequent. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but hist is the negative of the histogram. So when sorting, the keys are the negative histogram. So lower keys (more negative) come first. So tokens with higher frequency (lower keys) are placed earlier. That makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at make_sort(), the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). But in make_sort_freq(), it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort function is defined with a different signature. Let me check:\n\nOriginal make_sort() is:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the code, when make_sort is called in make_sort_freq(), it's passed as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So each key is made unique based on their position. That should handle ties.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is in the way the keys are being modified. Let me think: when two keys are the same, adding a small value based on their position will make them unique. So when sorted, the original order is preserved because the added value is tiny. That makes sense.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_unique(), the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). But according to the RASP rules, Aggregate should have a default of None. In the code, it's not specified, so it's using the default None. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort function is called with min_key=1. But in the example, when the keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become unique. So that's fine.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as the count, then negated. So when used as keys, lower values come first. So tokens with higher counts are placed earlier, which is correct.\n\nBut looking back, in make_hist(), the original code uses LEQ, which is incorrect. It should be EQ to count exact matches. So that's a bug. So I need to change that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, it uses min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is 5, then each added value is 0.2, 0.4, etc. But what if the original keys are such that adding these values could cause them to be equal again? For example, if two keys are 2 and 2.4, and the next position adds 0.2, making them 2.4 and 2.6. But that's probably acceptable as they are still unique.\n\nWait, but in the example given in make_sort_freq(), the input is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,1,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then when sorted, the order is based on these keys. So the first token (2) has key -2, which is the smallest, so it comes first. The second token (4) has key -1, which is next. The third token (2) also has key -2, but wait, no, because in the hist, each token's count is based on their occurrence. So in the input [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1]. Wait, no, make_hist() returns the count for each token. So for each position, it's the count of that token in the entire sequence.\n\nWait, no. make_hist() is supposed to return, for each token, the number of times it appears in the input. So for input [2,4,2,1], the hist would be [2,1,2,1]. So when negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when used as keys for sorting, the tokens are sorted based on these keys. So the first token (2) has key -2, the second (4) has -1, the third (2) has -2, and the fourth (1) has -1.\n\nWait, but when sorted, the order would be based on the keys. So the tokens with key -2 come before those with -1. So the sorted order would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort() function, when the keys are modified, it's using the original keys plus the position-based value. So in the make_sort_freq() case, the keys are the negated hist, which are [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort(), these keys are further modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i (starting from 0?), the key becomes:\n\nFor i=0: -2 + 1*0/5 = -2\ni=1: -1 +1*1/5 = -0.8\ni=2: -2 +1*2/5 = -1.6\ni=3: -1 +1*3/5 = -0.4\n\nSo the modified keys are [-2, -0.8, -1.6, -0.4]. Now, when sorted in ascending order, the order of the original indices would be 0, 2, 1, 3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nBut going back to make_hist(), the original code uses LEQ, which is wrong. It should be EQ. So that's the main issue.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified, but what if the original keys are not numeric? But in the note, it says that this approach only works for numerical keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the keys are the negated histogram counts, which are integers. So that's fine.\n\nSo the main bug is in make_hist(), where it uses LEQ instead of EQ. So I'll fix that.\n\nLet me go through each function again.\n\nmake_hist():\n- Creates a selector where each token is compared to itself with LEQ. That's incorrect because it's not just equality. For example, if a token is 3, it would select all tokens less than or equal to 3, which is not what we want. We only want to count exact matches. So changing the predicate to EQ.\n\nmake_sort_unique():\n- Seems correct. It creates a selector where each key is compared to others with LT, then counts how many are smaller. Then selects the position where the count equals the index, and aggregates the values.\n\nmake_sort():\n- Modifies keys correctly to ensure uniqueness.\n\nmake_sort_freq():\n- Uses the histogram correctly as keys, negated for sorting.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_hist(), changing the predicate from LEQ to EQ.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any other issues.\n\nIn make_sort(), the function is named correctly, and the parameters are passed properly.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is correctly negated, and make_sort is called with the right arguments.\n\nSo the only repair is in make_hist().\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2953, "total_tokens": 7572}}, {"id": "gen-1738410818-5qjtLlJ1CdSiAVGCshlz", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410818, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main correction was in the `make_hist()` function where the comparison predicate was changed from `LEQ` to `EQ` to accurately count token occurrences.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, not less than or equal. So that's a bug. I should change the predicate to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then it gets the target_pos as SelectorWidth. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. Finally, it aggregates vals with sel_new. But wait, the way it's selecting might not correctly map each position to the sorted value. Maybe the logic is flawed. I think the approach should be to create a selector where each row i selects the position where the key is the ith smallest. So perhaps the current implementation isn't correctly capturing that.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct.\n\nmake_sort_freq() uses make_hist() and then multiplies by -1 to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as keys. But since hist is the frequency, lower values should come first, so using make_sort with keys as hist should sort in ascending order. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being used to sort in ascending order because the comparison is LT. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated. So higher frequencies become more negative, which would sort them earlier. So the sorting should be correct.\n\nNow, focusing back on make_sort_unique(). The current approach might not correctly find the permutation. Let me think about how the RASP paper implements sort. Oh right, in the paper, they create a selector where each row i selects the position j where the key at j is the ith smallest. To do this, they compute for each j, how many keys are less than key j, which gives the rank. Then, for each i, select the j where the rank is i.\n\nIn the current code, 'smaller' is a selector where smaller[i,j] is True if key[i] < key[j]. Then target_pos[i] is the number of True in row i, which is the count of keys less than key[i]. So target_pos is the rank of each key. Then sel_new is a selector where sel_new[i,j] is True if target_pos[j] == i. So when we aggregate, each position i will take the value from the j where target_pos[j] == i, which is the ith smallest element.\n\nWait, but in the code, sel_new is created as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). So for each j, target_pos[j] is the rank. So for each i, sel_new[i,j] is True if target_pos[j] == i. So when we aggregate vals with sel_new, each i will get the value from the j where target_pos[j] == i, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the Aggregate is using sel_new as the selector and vals as the sop. So the output should be the sorted values. That seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that in the original code, the make_sort_unique function is not correctly handling cases where multiple elements have the same key. But the function's docstring says it only supports unique keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but looking back, in make_sort(), the function modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So that should handle the tie-breaking.\n\nNow, checking the make_hist() function again. The original code uses LEQ, which is incorrect. It should be EQ to count the exact matches. So I'll change that.\n\nAnother possible issue is in make_sort_freq(). The hist is computed as the count, then negated. So when sorting, the keys are -hist, so lower values (more negative) come first, which corresponds to higher frequencies. That should be correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the keys are the hist, which are the counts. So the sorting is based on the counts. But since we negated the counts, the sorting will be in ascending order of -count, which is descending order of count. So the most frequent tokens come first. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the counts are 2 for 2, 1 for 4, 1 for 1. So hist is [2,1,2,1]. Then negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the sorted order would be the elements with the smallest negated hist first. So -2 is smaller than -1, so the elements with count 2 come before those with count 1. So in the example, the two 2's come first, then 4, then 1. Which matches the expected output.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_hist() using LEQ instead of EQ. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_unique(), the function returns rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). But according to the RASP rules, Aggregate should have a default value of None. In the current code, it's not specified, so it defaults to None. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the Aggregate is called as rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). So the default is None, which is correct.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_hist(), changing the predicate to EQ.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any possible issues.\n\nIn make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Is this the correct way to break ties? Yes, because it adds a small value based on the position, ensuring that each key becomes unique.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the hist is correctly computed, then negated, and used as keys for sorting.\n\nSo the only bug is in make_hist().

In `make_hist()`, changed the comparison predicate from `LEQ` to `EQ` to properly count token occurrences.\n\n2. In `make_sort_freq()`, replaced the direct multiplication by `-1` with a proper `rasp.Map` operation to negate the histogram values, as direct multiplication by a scalar is not supported in RASP.\n\nThese changes ensure the programs adhere to RASP's constraints while maintaining their intended functionality.", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current implementation uses rasp.Select with LEQ, but that's not right. Because LEQ would select all tokens less than or equal, which isn't the correct way to count occurrences. Instead, I should use EQ to match each token exactly. So I'll change the predicate to Comparison.EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's using rasp.Select with keys and keys, but the way it's selecting might not correctly find the positions. Also, the selector is named but maybe not correctly used. I think the logic is to find for each position the number of keys smaller than the current, which gives the target position. Then, create a selector where each target position selects the corresponding value. That part seems okay, but I'll double-check the selector creation.\n\nIn make_sort(), the function is modifying the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But the way it's using rasp.SequenceMap might not correctly handle the indices. Wait, rasp.indices gives the position, starting from 0. So for each key x at position i, it's x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. That should make each key unique. But I need to ensure that the lambda function is correctly taking x and i. The current code uses lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, which seems correct. But I should verify if the parameters are passed correctly to SequenceMap.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It's using make_hist() to get the histogram, then negates it and uses make_sort(). But wait, when it negates, it's using -1 multiplied by the histogram. However, in RASP, you can't just multiply by a scalar like that. Instead, you should use rasp.Map to apply a lambda function. So instead of hist = -1 * make_hist(), it should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()). That way, each element is negated correctly.\n\nLet me go through each function step by step.\n\nFor make_hist():\n- The original code uses LEQ, which is incorrect. Changing to EQ.\n- So, same_tok should be created with Comparison.EQ.\n\nFor make_sort_unique():\n- The code seems okay, but I'll check if the selector is correctly applied. The target_pos is the count of smaller keys, which gives the position where the current element should be placed. Then, sel_new selects the position where target_pos equals the indices, which correctly picks the right value.\n\nFor make_sort():\n- The key modification seems correct. Using SequenceMap with x and i (indices) to add a unique value based on position. This ensures that keys are unique for sorting.\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n- The issue is with negating the histogram. Instead of multiplying by -1, which isn't allowed, I should use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that negates each element.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll adjust each function accordingly, making sure to use the correct operations and avoid any invalid syntax or operations.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1610, "total_tokens": 6229}}, {"id": "gen-1738411056-qW9qcn5oxeX3OddNRWY3", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411056, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified and fixed several issues in the provided functions.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, right? So maybe it should be EQ instead of LEQ. Because if we use LEQ, it might select more elements than intended, leading to incorrect counts.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then it gets the target_pos as SelectorWidth of 'smaller'. Then creates a selector sel_new with target_pos and indices EQ. Finally, aggregates vals with sel_new. Hmm, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4]. Let me think about how this works. The 'smaller' selector would be True where a key is less than another. The target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which would give the position where each element should be placed. Then sel_new selects the position, and aggregates the values. That seems correct, but maybe there's an issue with how the selector is used in Aggregate. Oh, wait, the Aggregate function in RASP requires a selector and an SOP. Here, sel_new is a selector, and vals is an SOP, so that's correct. But perhaps when multiple elements have the same key, this breaks because it's designed for unique keys. But the function is named make_sort_unique, so that's expected.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the call to make_sort_unique, it's passing (vals, keys). That should be fine. But perhaps there's an issue with how the keys are being modified. Let me check the example: when keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, each key is adjusted by a small amount based on their index. This should make them unique for sorting. Then, when sorted, the original values are ordered correctly. So that seems okay.\n\nThe problem might be in make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram as hist, then negates it so that higher frequencies come first. Then it calls make_sort with rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len and min_key. Wait, but in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But hist is a negative histogram, so adding a positive value based on index would make the keys unique. However, when sorting, the primary key is the frequency (negated hist), and the secondary key is the index, which ensures stability. But in the example given, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the histogram is [2,1,1,1], so hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, the keys become (-2 + 1*0/4, -1 +1*1/4, -1 +1*2/4, -1 +1*3/4). So the keys are [-2, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2 (index 0), then -0.75 (index1), -0.5 (index2), -0.25 (index3). So the sorted indices would be 0,1,2,3, which corresponds to the original order. But the desired output is [2,2,4,1], which is the input order. Wait, but the example expects [2,2,4,1], which is the same as the input. So that's correct. Hmm, maybe that's not the issue.\n\nWait, looking back at make_sort_freq(), the way it's called might be incorrect. The function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp. But in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't match because the function expects only max_seq_len. So the function definition is wrong. It should take max_seq_len as an argument, not vals and keys. So the function signature is incorrect. That's a problem.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). Wait, make_hist() returns an SOP, so multiplying by -1 would require a Map. So the code should be something like rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist). But in the current code, it's written as hist = -1 * make_hist(), which isn't valid because you can't multiply an SOP by a scalar directly. Instead, you need to use rasp.Map. So that's another issue.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. In make_hist(), the Select should use EQ instead of LEQ.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the function signature is incorrect. It shouldn't take vals and keys as parameters because it's supposed to work on the tokens. Or perhaps the function is intended to be more general, but in the example, it's called with tokens. Alternatively, perhaps the function should take the tokens as an argument. But looking at the original code, the function is defined without vals and keys, but in the example, it's called with them. So that's a mistake. The function should either take the necessary SOPs as arguments or use rasp.tokens directly.\n\nWait, the original code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut in the example, it's called as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That suggests that the function should take vals and keys, but the current definition doesn't. So the function signature is wrong. It should probably take vals and keys as parameters, with default values if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is intended to always operate on rasp.tokens, so the parameters are unnecessary. But the example shows it being called with tokens, which suggests that the function should accept them.\n\nSo, to fix make_sort_freq(), the function should take vals and keys as parameters, perhaps with default values. For example:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens, keys: rasp.SOp = rasp.tokens, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the original code, it's not the case. So that's another issue.\n\nAdditionally, the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOP by a scalar. Instead, you need to use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that multiplies each element by -1.\n\nSo, to fix that, it should be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\"))\n\nPutting all these together, the main issues are:\n\n- make_hist() uses LEQ instead of EQ.\n- make_sort_freq() has an incorrect function signature and incorrectly computes the negative histogram.\n\nSo, the steps to repair:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the predicate from LEQ to EQ.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), correct the function signature to accept vals and keys, and compute the histogram correctly using Map.\n3. Ensure that all functions use the correct operations and that the selectors are properly constructed.\n\nLet me outline the corrected code:\n\nFor make_hist():\n- Change rasp.Comparison.LEQ to EQ.\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n- Add parameters vals and keys with default rasp.tokens.\n- Compute hist as make_hist() applied to vals.\n- Negate hist using rasp.Map.\n- Call make_sort with vals, hist, max_seq_len, and min_key.\n\nWait, but in the original make_sort_freq(), it's using hist as the keys. So the function should compute the histogram of the tokens, negate it, and then sort based on that.\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort_freq() would:\n\n- Compute the histogram of the input tokens.\n- Negate each value in the histogram so that higher frequencies come first.\n- Use this negated histogram as the keys for sorting.\n- Use the tokens as the values to sort.\n\nThus, the function should take the tokens as the vals and keys, but perhaps allow them to be specified.\n\nWait, but in the example, the function is called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the first two arguments are vals and keys. So the function signature should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the original code, it's defined with only max_seq_len. So that's incorrect.\n\nSo, to fix, the function should have vals and keys as parameters, perhaps with defaults.\n\nPutting it all together, the corrected functions would be:\n\nmake_hist() uses EQ.\n\nmake_sort_freq() is adjusted to take vals and keys, compute their histogram, negate it, and sort.\n\nAlso, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq(), the min_key is set to 1. That should be okay.\n\nSo, the final code would have:\n\n- make_hist() corrected.\n- make_sort_freq() with correct parameters and histogram negation.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq(), the min_key is 1, which is fine. But when the keys are negative (because hist is negative), adding a small positive value based on index would make them unique.\n\nI think that's the main issues. Now, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2964, "total_tokens": 7583}}, {"id": "gen-1738411171-JyJ2LOZKf1j1OIkoD5RS", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411171, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fix the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_hist()` function where the comparison operator was incorrect.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target position by counting the number of smaller elements. The selector 'sel_new' is trying to select the position where the index equals target_pos. But wait, target_pos is a sequence where each element is the count of smaller keys. So for each position, we're looking for the index that matches this count. However, if there are duplicate keys, this might not work correctly because multiple positions could have the same count. But the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so maybe it's okay. But perhaps using EQ is correct here.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. The lambda function is `x + min_key * i / max_seq_len`. Wait, adding min_key multiplied by index divided by max_seq_len. But if min_key is 1, then each key is incremented by i/max_seq_len. That should ensure uniqueness as long as the original keys are within a certain range. But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. However, the function seems logically correct as per the comment.\n\nNow, `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it uses `make_sort` with hist as keys. But wait, the parameters passed to `make_sort` are `rasp.tokens` as vals and hist as keys. But in the example, the function is called as `make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)`, which doesn't match the function definition. Oh, wait, the function definition of `make_sort_freq` only takes max_seq_len as an argument. So the example usage is incorrect. But looking back, the original code's `make_sort_freq` function is defined with `def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:`, which is correct. So the example usage in the comment is wrong, but the code is correct. So no issue there.\n\nWait, in `make_sort_freq`, it's returning `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)`. But `make_sort` expects `vals` and `keys` as the first two arguments. So here, `vals` is `rasp.tokens` and `keys` is `hist`. That makes sense because we're sorting the tokens based on their frequency (hist). But since hist is negated, higher frequencies come first. Wait, no: in `make_sort`, the keys are being used to determine the order. So if hist is negated, then lower hist values (which are more negative) will be considered smaller, so they will be sorted first. So the sorting is in ascending order of the negated hist, which is descending order of the original hist. So tokens with higher frequency come first. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the output is [2, 2, 4, 1], which is the input sorted by frequency. So 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorted order is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in `make_sort`, when creating the new keys, the lambda is `x + min_key * i / max_seq_len`. But using division here might cause issues with integer keys. Maybe it's better to multiply instead? Or perhaps it's fine if the keys are floats. But the function is intended for numerical keys, so it's acceptable.\n\nWait, in `make_sort`, the keys are being modified by adding a term that's min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, the key is incremented by a small amount. This ensures that each key is unique, allowing the sort to be stable even if original keys are the same. That makes sense.\n\nBut let me check the `make_sort_unique` function again. It uses `rasp.Select` to create 'smaller' as keys < keys. Then 'target_pos' is the count of smaller elements, which gives the position where each element should be placed. Then 'sel_new' is a selector where target_pos equals the indices. So for each element, it selects the position where it should go. Then it aggregates the values using this selector. That should correctly sort the values based on the keys.\n\nWait, but in the `make_sort_unique` function, the 'sel_new' is created as `rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)`. So for each element in target_pos, it's checking if it equals each index. So the selector will have True at the correct positions. Then, when aggregating, each value is placed in its correct spot. That seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issue I spotted was in `make_hist()`, where using LEQ instead of EQ would cause incorrect counts. So changing that should fix the function.\n\nSo the corrected `make_hist()` should use EQ. Let me update that.\n\nAnother thing: in `make_sort_freq`, the hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. But I should ensure that the sorting is done correctly. Since `make_sort` sorts based on the keys in ascending order, using negated hist will sort from highest frequency to lowest.\n\nWait, no. If hist is the count, then negating it makes it negative. So when sorted in ascending order (which is the default), the most negative (highest original count) comes first. So the sorted order is correct.\n\nI think that's the main issue. So the corrected code should have `make_hist()` using EQ instead of LEQ.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2081, "total_tokens": 6700}}, {"id": "gen-1738411246-LTBrtqm5zmnMcXrp3AwF", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411246, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and addressed them:\n\n1. **make_hist()**: The comparison operator was incorrect.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, right? So maybe it should be EQ instead of LEQ. Because if we use LEQ, it might select more elements than intended, leading to incorrect counts. So I'll change that to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then it gets the target_pos as SelectorWidth of smaller. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. Finally, it aggregates sel_new with vals. Hmm, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4]. Let me see: the smaller selector would compare each key to others. For each position, target_pos would be the number of keys smaller than it. So for 2, there's 1 (which is 1), so target_pos is 1. Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices. But wait, indices start at 0. So maybe the comparison should be target_pos equals indices plus 1? Or perhaps the way target_pos is calculated is off. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the current setup doesn't correctly map to the sorted positions. I'm not sure yet, but perhaps the logic is correct. I'll come back to this after checking other functions.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and uses it as keys for sorting. The idea is that higher frequency tokens come first. But when it calls make_sort, it passes hist as keys. Wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But hist is a SOp that's negative, so adding a positive value might not be the right approach. Also, in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using hist as the keys, but in the example, after negating hist, the keys would be [-2, -1, -2, -1] for input [2,4,2,1]. So when sorted, the most frequent (2) comes first. But when make_sort adds min_key * i / max_seq_len, it's adding a small value, which might interfere with the sorting. Maybe the min_key should be negative? Or perhaps the approach of adding is incorrect because the hist is negative. Alternatively, perhaps the way the keys are adjusted in make_sort() isn't suitable for this case. Maybe the min_key and max_seq_len parameters are not being used correctly in make_sort_freq.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1). So the keys are hist, which is negative. Then in make_sort, keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, we add 1 * i / max_seq_len to the hist. But hist is negative, so this would make the keys less negative. But when sorting in ascending order, this might not correctly order by frequency. Maybe the adjustment should be subtracted instead, or perhaps the min_key should be negative. Alternatively, perhaps the approach of adding is causing the keys to not be unique in the way intended.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. But if min_key is positive, this adds a positive value, which for negative x might not make them unique in the right way. Maybe instead, we should subtract to ensure that higher frequencies (more negative) come first. Or perhaps the adjustment should be done differently.\n\nWait, the make_sort function is supposed to sort the vals based on the keys. So if the keys are the negative histogram, we want to sort in ascending order, which would place the most frequent tokens first. But when we add min_key * i / max_seq_len, which is positive, it's adding to the negative keys. So for example, if a token has a frequency of 2, its key is -2. Adding i*1/5 (if max_seq_len is 5) would make it -2 + 0.2, -2 + 0.4, etc. But when sorted in ascending order, -2 + 0.2 is less than -2 + 0.4, so the earlier positions would come first. But I'm not sure if this correctly breaks ties. Maybe the adjustment is causing the sort to not work as intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is in make_sort_unique. Let me think about how it works. The smaller selector is created by comparing each key to others. For each key, target_pos is the number of keys smaller than it. Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals the index. So for the example [2,4,3,1], the keys are [2,4,3,1]. The smaller selector would be:\n\nFor each i, how many keys j have key[j] < key[i].\n\nSo for i=0 (key=2), keys less than 2 are only 1, so target_pos=1.\n\ni=1 (key=4), all others are less, so target_pos=3.\n\ni=2 (key=3), keys less are 2 and 1, so target_pos=2.\n\ni=3 (key=1), no keys less, target_pos=0.\n\nThen sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals indices. So for each i, we select j where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nSo for i=0, target_pos is 1, so j=1 is selected. So the aggregate for position 0 will take the value from j=1, which is 4. But that's not correct because the sorted output should be [1,2,3,4]. Hmm, that suggests that the logic in make_sort_unique is flawed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the aggregate works. The sel_new is a selector where for each row i, it's True at column j if target_pos[i] == j. Then, when we aggregate vals using this selector, each position i will take the value from j where target_pos[i] == j. So in the example, for i=0, target_pos is 1, so j=1 is selected, and the value is 4. But that's not the desired output. So the logic is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The current approach in make_sort_unique is not correctly mapping the values to their sorted positions. Instead of selecting the value at j where target_pos[i] == j, perhaps we need to select the value at i where target_pos[j] == i. Or maybe the selector is constructed incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the selector should be such that for each position i in the output, we select the j where j is the position that should come at i. So for the example, the sorted order is [1,2,3,4], which are at positions 3,0,2,1. So for output position 0, we need to select j=3. For position 1, j=0, etc.\n\nSo how can we create a selector that for each i, selects j where j is the index that should be at position i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current approach is trying to compute the rank of each element, but the way it's used in the selector is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the selector is constructed as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). So for each i, it's checking if target_pos[i] equals the index j. So the selector will have True at (i,j) where j = target_pos[i]. Then, when we aggregate, each i will take the value from j = target_pos[i]. So in the example, for i=0, j=1 is selected, so the value is 4, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the current selector is selecting the wrong positions. Instead, perhaps we need to create a selector where for each j, if target_pos[j] == i, then (i,j) is True. That way, when aggregating, each i will collect the value from j where j's target_pos is i.\n\nSo how can we create such a selector? Instead of Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), perhaps we need to swap the keys and queries. Because target_pos is a SOp that for each j, gives the target position i. So to create a selector where (i,j) is True if j's target_pos is i, we can do Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each i, we compare it to target_pos[j], and if equal, select j.\n\nSo in the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for i=0, we look for j where target_pos[j] == 0, which is j=3. So the selector for i=0 will select j=3, which has value 1. For i=1, j=0 (value 2). For i=2, j=2 (value3). For i=3, j=1 (value4). So the aggregated result would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the mistake in make_sort_unique is that the selector is constructed as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ), but it should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because we want to select j where target_pos[j] equals i.\n\nSo to fix make_sort_unique, I need to change sel_new to be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\nLet me update that.\n\nNow, checking make_sort_freq again. It uses make_sort with hist as keys. Hist is the negative of the histogram. So higher frequency tokens have more negative keys. When sorted in ascending order, they come first. But in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each position i, the key is x + (1 * i)/max_seq_len. Since x is negative, adding a small positive value makes it less negative. So the keys become x + delta, where delta is small. But when sorted in ascending order, the tokens with the most negative x (highest frequency) will have the smallest keys after adding delta. So the order should be correct. But I'm not sure if the adjustment is necessary in this case. Alternatively, perhaps the adjustment should be subtracted instead. Or maybe the min_key should be negative. Hmm, but in make_sort_freq, min_key is set to 1, which is positive. So adding it would make the keys less negative. But when sorted, the most negative (highest frequency) would still come first. So perhaps it's okay.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose we have tokens [2,4,2,1]. The hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort, keys are modified by adding 1 * i / max_seq_len. Let's say max_seq_len is 4. So for each i (0-based), the addition is 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75.\n\nSo the modified keys would be:\n\ni=0: -2 + 0 = -2\n\ni=1: -1 + 0.25 = -0.75\n\ni=2: -2 + 0.5 = -1.5\n\ni=3: -1 + 0.75 = -0.25\n\nSo the keys are [-2, -0.75, -1.5, -0.25]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2 (i=0), -1.5 (i=2), -0.75 (i=1), -0.25 (i=3). So the sorted order of indices is 0,2,1,3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo the adjustment seems to work in this case. But what if there are ties in the adjusted keys? Well, the adjustment ensures that each key is unique, so the sorting will be stable.\n\nSo the main issue was in make_sort_unique, where the selector was constructed incorrectly. Fixing that should resolve the problem.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the call to make_sort is using rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. That's correct because we want to sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nSo, to summarize the fixes:\n\n1. In make_hist(), change the comparison from LEQ to EQ to correctly count occurrences.\n\n2. In make_sort_unique(), change the selector from Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ) to Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ).\n\nI think these changes should fix the programs.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 3601, "total_tokens": 8220}}, {"id": "gen-1738411379-brEWLyXzqXN4z16hW0S7", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411379, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main correction was in the `make_hist()` function where the comparison predicate was changed from `LEQ` to `EQ` to accurately count token occurrences.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with LEQ comparison. Wait, LEQ is less than or equal, but to count occurrences, we should check for equality, right? So maybe it should be EQ instead of LEQ. Because if we use LEQ, it might select more elements than intended, leading to incorrect counts. So I'll change that to EQ.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It uses rasp.Select with keys and keys, comparison LT. Then it gets the target_pos as SelectorWidth of smaller. Then sel_new is a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. Finally, it aggregates sel_new with vals. Hmm, but when multiple keys are the same, this might not handle them correctly. Also, the example shows that it's supposed to return the values sorted by keys. Wait, maybe the issue is that the current implementation doesn't correctly handle cases where keys have duplicates. But the function is supposed to handle only unique keys, so perhaps it's okay. I'll leave it for now.\n\nLooking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems correct, but I should check if the way keys are modified is accurate. The lambda function is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. Wait, rasp.indices starts at 0, so for each position i, it adds a small value to the key, ensuring that keys are unique. That makes sense.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first. But wait, when you negate the histogram, lower values come first. So when sorting, it should arrange from lowest to highest, which would be tokens with lower frequency first. But the example shows that in [2,4,2,1], the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorting is based on frequency descending. But with the current code, since hist is negated, the keys are -2, -1, -2, -1. So when sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to 2,2,4,1. That's correct. So maybe the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort is using hist as the key. But in the example, the tokens are [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1]. So negated hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When passed to make_sort, which sorts by the keys in ascending order. So the sorted order would be based on the negated hist, so lower values first. So the tokens would be ordered as 2 (hist -2), 2 (hist -2), 4 (hist -1), 1 (hist -1). Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the make_sort function is called with hist as keys. So in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq, min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is passed. So each key (which is -hist) is modified by adding 1 * i / max_seq_len. So for each token, its key becomes (-hist_i) + (i / max_seq_len). This ensures that when two tokens have the same -hist, the one with a smaller index comes first, preserving the original order. That makes sense.\n\nBut let me check the functions again.\n\nIn make_hist(), the original code uses LEQ, which is incorrect. It should be EQ to count exact matches. So I'll fix that.\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), the code seems correct, but perhaps the way it's selecting is off. Let me think: smaller is a selector where each row i is True for all j where keys[j] < keys[i]. Then target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which gives the number of elements smaller than the current key. So for each i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than keys[i]. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the index, which effectively picks the correct position to place each value. Then aggregate selects the value at that position. That should correctly sort the values. So maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the example for make_sort, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3,3,2,0] because:\n\nFor i=0 (key=2), how many keys are less than 2? Only key at i=3 (1) \u2192 count is 1? Wait, no. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the keys are [2,4,3,1]. For each i:\n\ni=0: key=2. How many keys are less than 2? Only 1 (at i=3). So target_pos[0] is 1.\n\ni=1: key=4. All other keys (2,3,1) are less than 4. So target_pos[1] is 3.\n\ni=2: key=3. Keys less than 3 are 2 and 1 \u2192 count is 2.\n\ni=3: key=1. No keys less than 1 \u2192 count is 0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0].\n\nThen sel_new is a selector where for each i, it's True where target_pos[i] equals the index j. So for each i, it selects the j where j == target_pos[i].\n\nSo for i=0, j=1 \u2192 selects position 1.\n\ni=1, j=3 \u2192 selects position 3.\n\ni=2, j=2 \u2192 selects position 2.\n\ni=3, j=0 \u2192 selects position 0.\n\nThen aggregate picks the value at these positions.\n\nSo the output would be [vals[3], vals[0], vals[2], vals[1]] \u2192 [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the make_sort_unique function seems correct.\n\nNow, the make_sort function: it takes keys and modifies them by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So each key is made unique by adding a small value based on their position. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. That should handle cases with duplicate keys.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, the hist is calculated, then negated, and used as keys. So tokens with higher frequency have lower keys, so they come first when sorted in ascending order. But wait, when you negate the hist, higher frequency becomes more negative, so when sorted in ascending order, they come first. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, the keys are being modified, but in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negated hist. So when make_sort is called, it's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to the negated hist. So for tokens with the same frequency, their keys will be slightly different, ensuring that their order is preserved as per their original positions.\n\nSo the functions seem correct, except for make_hist using LEQ instead of EQ.\n\nWait, another thing: in make_sort_freq, the hist is multiplied by -1. So the keys are -hist. But when passed to make_sort, which then adds min_key * i / max_seq_len, that's correct because it's ensuring that for the same frequency, the order is determined by the position.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_hist. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in make_hist, change the predicate from LEQ to EQ. That should fix the histogram calculation.\n\nTesting the example: for input \"abac\", the tokens are ['a','b','a','c']. The hist should be [2,1,2,1]. Let's see:\n\nsame_tok is a selector where each element (i,j) is True if token[i] == token[j]. So for each row i, the count is the number of times token[i] appears.\n\nSo after changing to EQ, same_tok will correctly count the occurrences.\n\nThus, the corrected make_hist function should use EQ.\n\nNow, I'll update the code accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 2557, "total_tokens": 7176}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs.
