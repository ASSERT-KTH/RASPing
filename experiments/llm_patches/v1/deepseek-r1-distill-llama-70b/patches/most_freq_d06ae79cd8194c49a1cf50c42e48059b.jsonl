Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears by selecting all positions where the token is equal. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, the return statement has rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1. Oh, that's a problem because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Maybe it was intended to reverse the order, but the correct way would be to sort in ascending order without multiplying. So I should remove the * -1.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. Then calls make_sort_unique. The issue here is that in the original code, the keys are being modified, but in the function definition, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). Wait, in the problem statement, the user provided a function make_sort with these parameters, but in the code, the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. That seems correct.\n\nBut looking at make_sort_freq(), it's calling make_sort with (rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). Wait, the parameters for make_sort are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key), so the call should pass vals as rasp.tokens, keys as hist, and then the keyword arguments. That seems correct.\n\nWait, no, in the code provided, the make_sort_freq function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. Then inside, it calls make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But the make_sort function expects vals and keys as the first two arguments, followed by max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. So the call is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That should be fine.\n\nBut looking back at make_sort_unique(), the return statement is rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1, which is invalid. So that's the main issue. Also, in make_sort(), when it modifies the keys, it uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But since i is the index (starting from 0), this might not ensure uniqueness if the min_key is too small. But perhaps that's acceptable for the problem's constraints.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_unique(), the 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Then Aggregate is used to pick the corresponding vals. But the way it's structured, each position in the output will pick the value from the position where the number of smaller keys equals the current index. That should correctly sort the values in ascending order. But the multiplication by -1 is wrong because it's not a valid operation. So removing that should fix it.\n\nSo the main correction is in make_sort_unique(), removing the * -1 in the return statement.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. make_hist() seems correct. make_sort() seems okay except for the key modification. make_sort_freq() uses make_hist correctly and then negates it, which might be intended to sort in ascending order of frequency, but since make_sort_unique sorts in ascending order, using negative hist would sort from highest to lowest frequency. Wait, no: hist is the count, so -hist would be lower for higher frequencies. So when passed to make_sort, which sorts by keys in ascending order, using -hist as keys would sort the tokens in descending order of frequency. But the example in make_sort_freq shows that [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is sorted by frequency (2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once). So the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nWait, in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1]. The hist for 2 is 2, 4 is 1, 1 is 1. So when we make hist = -1 * hist, the keys become -2, -1, -1, -1. Then sorting by these keys in ascending order would place -2 first (since it's smaller), then the -1s. So the sorted order would be 2,2,4,1, which matches the example. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the main issue is the multiplication by -1 in make_sort_unique's return statement. That's invalid and should be removed.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), when modifying the keys, the code uses rasp.SequenceMap with keys and indices. But the way it's written, it's adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. This ensures that each key is unique because each position adds a unique value based on its index. So that should work.\n\nSo to summarize, the corrections needed are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), remove the * -1 from the return statement.\n2. Ensure that all other functions are correctly structured.\n\nLet me write the corrected code accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2011, "total_tokens": 6634}}, {"id": "gen-1738410389-eNOJHu9PP0bB2gxBbNgj", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410389, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified that the `make_sort_unique` function incorrectly multiplied the result by -1, which was unnecessary and led to incorrect sorting behavior.

That doesn't make sense because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 would invert the values, which isn't intended for sorting. That's probably a bug. So I should remove the * -1.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. Then calls make_sort_unique. The modification seems correct, but I should check the parameters. The function is called with max_seq_len and min_key, which are used to create unique keys. That makes sense for numerical keys to avoid ties.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram (hist) as the negative of make_hist(). Wait, why negative? Because in make_sort(), the keys are being sorted in ascending order. So if we want to sort by frequency, higher frequency should come first. But hist is the count, so using -hist would sort in descending order. That makes sense. Then it calls make_sort with tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len. But wait, the original make_sort function expects keys to be unique, which is ensured by the modification in make_sort(). However, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is based on token counts, which might not be unique. So adding the position-based term would ensure uniqueness. But in the current code, the keys in make_sort_freq() are set to hist, which is the negative of the histogram. So when passed to make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But min_key is set to 1, which is fine. So this should correctly sort tokens by frequency, with higher counts first, and for ties, the original order is preserved because the position is used as a tiebreaker. So I don't see an issue here.\n\nWait, but looking back at make_sort(), the function signature in the provided code is:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the original code, the make_sort_freq() function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort() function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each key x at position i, the new key is x + (min_key * i)/max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique because the added term is small enough not to overlap for different positions. So that should work.\n\nBut let me check the make_sort_unique() function again. The 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Then Aggregate is used to pick the vals where sel_new is true. But the return statement is rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1, which is incorrect. Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 would apply it element-wise, but that's not intended here. So I need to remove the * -1.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique(), where the return statement incorrectly multiplies the result by -1. That's a bug because it would invert the values, which isn't the intended behavior for sorting.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), when creating the modified keys, the code uses rasp.SequenceMap with a lambda that adds min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in RASP, the indices start from 0. So for position i, the term is min_key * i / max_seq_len. This should create a unique key for each position, ensuring that the sort is stable even when keys are the same.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(). So the hist is negative because we want to sort in descending order. But when passed to make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding a small value based on position, which would affect the sorting order. However, since the added term is small, the primary sorting key is the frequency, and the position is used as a tiebreaker. So that should be correct.\n\nSo the main repair needed is in make_sort_unique(), removing the * -1 in the return statement.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the return statement should be:\n\nreturn rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\ninstead of multiplying by -1.\n\n2. Check if there are any other issues. For example, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is correctly computed as the negative of the histogram to sort in descending order.\n\nSo the corrected code would fix the make_sort_unique() function by removing the multiplication by -1.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 1963, "total_tokens": 6586}}, {"id": "gen-1738410520-SxIc69P135kLU8K5HdfE", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410520, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the result was incorrectly multiplied by -1.

However, the code returns rasp.Aggregate(...) named \"sort\" multiplied by -1. That doesn't make sense because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 would not be valid. So this is a bug. Instead, the code should just return the Aggregate without multiplying.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. Then calls make_sort_unique.

The idea is that higher frequency tokens come first. But when it calls make_sort, it passes rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. Wait, no, looking at the code: hist is -1 * make_hist(), so lower values mean higher frequency. Then make_sort is called with vals=rasp.tokens and keys=hist. So it's sorting the tokens based on their frequency. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the code seems correct, but let me check the parameters. The function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp, and inside it calls make_sort with max_seq_len and min_key=1. That looks correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_unique, the code returns rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1. That's the problem. Because in the example, when you aggregate, you get the correct order, but multiplying by -1 would invert the values, which is not intended. So that line is wrong.

Also, check if all functions are using the correct parameters and that there are no other issues.\n\nWait, looking again at make_sort_unique:\n\nThe code is:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\nreturn rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\") * -1\n\nBut Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't valid. So this is incorrect. The correct return should be just the Aggregate.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_unique should return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\").\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq, the initial code has a comment that says it's called with make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), but the function definition is make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int). So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures uniqueness.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, the return statement has rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1. Oh, that's a problem because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Instead, maybe they intended to reverse the order. So perhaps the Aggregate is being used incorrectly. Let me think: the target_pos is the count of keys less than current key, so it's like the rank. Using Aggregate with sel_new would pick the value at the target_pos index. But then multiplying by -1 doesn't make sense. Maybe the original code intended to sort in ascending order, but the way it's done is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the selector is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the smaller selector would be a matrix where each row i has True for all j where keys[j] < keys[i]. The width of this would be the number of elements smaller than each key. So for [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), which for each position i, selects the j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, only j=3 (since target_pos[3]=0). For i=1, j=0 and j=2 (target_pos[0]=1, target_pos[2]=2? Wait, no. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, for keys = [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector is:\n\nRow 0 (key=2): which keys are less than 2? Only key at position 3 (value 1). So width is 1.\n\nRow 1 (key=4): all keys except itself are smaller. So width is 3.\n\nRow 2 (key=3): keys 2 and 1 are smaller. Width is 2.\n\nRow 3 (key=1): no keys are smaller. Width is 0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). So for each row i, it's checking if target_pos[j] == i. So row 0 would select j where target_pos[j] is 0, which is only j=3. So the selector for row 0 is [0,0,0,1]. Then Aggregate with vals would take the value at j=3 for each row 0, which is 1. So the output would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the return is rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals) * -1. That doesn't make sense because Aggregate returns a sequence, and multiplying by -1 would invert each element, which isn't what we want. So that's a bug. The correct code should just return the Aggregate without multiplying.\n\nSo the fix is to remove the * -1 part. So the return statement should be return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\").\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It takes vals, keys, max_seq_len, and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key, where i is the index. This is to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique with the modified keys. That seems okay, but I should check if the way keys are modified is correct. For example, adding a small value based on index to break ties. That makes sense.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, then negates it (hist = -1 * make_hist()). Wait, why negate? Because when sorting, lower frequency should come first, so by negating, the sort order will be based on higher frequencies first. But then it passes this hist as the key to make_sort. So the code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist()\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,1,1]. Negated, it's [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then when sorted by these keys, the order would be based on the negated hist. So the tokens with higher frequency come first. So in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the way the keys are modified in make_sort() is by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each token, the key becomes key + (min_key * index) / max_seq_len. Since the key is the negated histogram, adding this would ensure that for tokens with the same frequency, the one with a lower index comes first, which maintains the original order for ties. That makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at make_sort_freq(), the function signature is def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, it's called as sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). Wait, that's inconsistent. The function definition only takes max_seq_len, but in the example, it's being called with three arguments. That's a problem. So the function definition is incorrect.\n\nWait, the original code has:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut in the example usage, the user wrote:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n\nWhich suggests that make_sort_freq is being called with vals and keys, but according to the function definition, it only takes max_seq_len. So this is a mistake. The function should probably take vals and keys as arguments, but in the current code, it's not. So the function is incorrectly defined.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nBut this hardcodes the keys as rasp.tokens and the vals as rasp.tokens. So the function doesn't allow the user to pass their own vals and keys. That's probably a bug. The function should instead take vals and keys as parameters, similar to make_sort.\n\nSo the correct function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the current code, it's not. So that's another issue.\n\nWait, but the example usage in the code says:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) >> [2,2,4,1]\n\nWhich suggests that make_sort_freq is a function that takes vals, keys, and max_seq_len. So the function definition is wrong. It should have vals and keys as parameters.\n\nSo to fix this, I need to modify make_sort_freq to accept vals and keys, and then compute the histogram based on those keys.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq uses rasp.tokens to compute the histogram. That's incorrect because it should use the provided keys. So the code is using the wrong keys for the histogram.\n\nSo the steps to fix make_sort_freq are:\n\n1. Modify the function signature to accept vals and keys, with max_seq_len as a required parameter.\n\n2. Compute the histogram based on the provided keys, not rasp.tokens.\n\nSo the corrected function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")  # Compute histogram of keys\n    negated_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)  # Negate to sort in ascending order of frequency\n    # Then sort vals based on negated_hist as keys, ensuring uniqueness\n    return make_sort(vals, negated_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the hist was computed as make_hist(), which uses rasp.tokens. So that's incorrect because the keys might not be tokens. So the function should compute the histogram of the provided keys.\n\nWait, no. The histogram is the count of each token in the input. But if the keys are different, perhaps the histogram should be based on the keys. For example, if keys are the tokens, then it's correct. But if keys are something else, like indices, then the histogram would be incorrect.\n\nWait, in the example, the keys are the tokens, so it's correct. But in general, the function should compute the histogram of the keys, not the tokens. So the make_hist() function should be applied to the keys, not to rasp.tokens.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, the hist should be computed as the histogram of the keys. So the code should be:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")  # This uses rasp.tokens, which is wrong.\n\nInstead, it should be a histogram of the keys. So perhaps we need to create a new function or adjust how hist is computed.\n\nWait, make_hist() returns the count of each token in the input. So if the keys are the same as the tokens, it's correct. But if the keys are different, then the histogram is wrong.\n\nSo to correctly compute the histogram of the keys, we need to create a new function or adjust the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_hist function can be modified to take an SOp as input, but in the current code, make_hist() uses rasp.tokens internally.\n\nSo to fix this, I'll need to adjust make_sort_freq to compute the histogram based on the provided keys.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create a new function, like make_hist_from_keys(keys: rasp.SOp) that computes the histogram of the keys. But since I can't modify make_hist(), I'll have to compute it within make_sort_freq.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, I can compute the histogram of the keys by using rasp.Select on the keys.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute a selector where each element in keys is compared to itself for equality.\n\nsame_key = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\n2. Compute the width of this selector to get the histogram.\n\nhist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_key)\n\n3. Negate the histogram so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first.\n\nnegated_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n\n4. Use this negated_hist as the key in make_sort.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_sort_freq function would be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_key = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_key\")\n    hist = rasp.SelectorWidth(same_key).named(\"hist\")\n    negated_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"negated_hist\")\n    sorted_vals = make_sort(vals, negated_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n    return sorted_vals.named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the function didn't take vals and keys as parameters. So the function definition is incorrect. So I need to adjust the function signature to accept vals and keys.\n\nSo the final steps are:\n\n- Fix make_sort_unique() by removing the * -1.\n\n- Fix make_sort_freq()'s function signature to accept vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n- Compute the histogram based on the provided keys instead of rasp.tokens.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the return statement should be:\n\nreturn rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\ninstead of multiplying by -1.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the function should be redefined to take vals, keys, and max_seq_len.\n\n3. Inside make_sort_freq(), compute the histogram based on the provided keys, negate it, and pass to make_sort.\n\nSo now, I'll write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3668, "total_tokens": 8291}}, {"id": "gen-1738410722-ornLcjbAfaenzH33LSt7", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410722, "choices": [{"error": {"message": "Exception: Chunk too big", "code": 502, "metadata": {"provider_name": "DeepInfra", "raw": {"error_type": "unknown_error", "error_message": "Exception: Chunk too big"}}}, "logprobs": null, "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main issue in the provided RASP program is the incorrect multiplication by -1 in the `make_sort_unique` function, which inverts the output values.

For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, the example shows that make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens) sorts [2,4,3,1] to [1,2,3,4]. Let me see: the 'smaller' selector for keys [2,4,3,1] would be a matrix where each row i has True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. So for i=0 (key=2), j=3 (key=1) is True. For i=1 (key=4), j=0,2,3 are True. For i=2 (key=3), j=0,3. For i=3 (key=1), none. So target_pos would be [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is where target_pos equals indices. So for each position i, it's looking for j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=3 (since target_pos[3]=0). For i=1, j=0. For i=2, j=2. For i=3, j=1. So when we aggregate vals (which are the tokens [2,4,3,1]) with sel_new, each position i will take the value from j where target_pos[j] == i. So position 0 takes j=3's value, which is 1. Position 1 takes j=0's value, 2. Position 2 takes j=2's value, 3. Position 3 takes j=1's value,4. So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. So make_sort_unique seems okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, the return is rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\") * -1. Oh, wait, that's a problem. Because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 would apply a Map. But in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct without the multiplication. So why is there a * -1? That would invert the values, which is not desired. So that's a bug. The line should just return the Aggregate without multiplying by -1.\n\nSo in make_sort_unique, the return statement is wrong. It should be return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"). The *-1 is incorrect and would cause the output to be negative, which doesn't make sense for sorting.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique using max_seq_len and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems correct because it ensures that each key is unique, allowing the sort to work properly even with duplicates.\n\nThen make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, then negates it (hist = -1 * make_hist()). Wait, why negate? Because when sorting, lower frequencies should come first. So by negating, the sort will arrange from highest to lowest frequency. But then it passes hist as the key to make_sort. So tokens are sorted based on their negative frequency, which would order them from most frequent to least. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should become [2,2,4,1]. Let's see: the histogram is [2,1,1,1] for tokens [2,4,2,1]. So hist is [2,1,1,1], then -1 * hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When used as keys, the sort will arrange the tokens in the order of their keys from smallest to largest. So the keys are [-2, -1, -1, -1]. So the sorted order would be the first token (key -2), then the others. So the output would be [2,4,2,1], but wait, the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the example says that make_sort_freq with max_seq_len=5 on input [2,4,2,1] returns [2,2,4,1]. So the histogram is [2,1,1,1]. So when we negate, it's [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, when sorting, the keys are these negative frequencies. So the sort should arrange the tokens in the order of their keys from smallest to largest. So the smallest key is -2 (for token 2), then the next are -1 for tokens 4,2,1. So the sorted order would be token 2 (position 0), then tokens 4 (position1), 2 (position2), and 1 (position3). So the output would be [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So that's a problem. So the current implementation is not handling the sorting correctly when there are ties in frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when frequencies are the same, the order in the input is preserved. So in the example, tokens 4,2,1 have the same frequency. So in the output, their order should be as per their original positions. But the current implementation may not be handling that.\n\nWait, looking at make_sort(), it uses make_sort_unique, which requires unique keys. So when we add min_key * i / max_seq_len to the keys, each key becomes unique. So for the hist, which is the same for some tokens, adding their index would make the keys unique. So when sorted, the tokens with the same frequency would be ordered based on their original positions because their modified keys would be different.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram. So for each token, key is -hist[i]. Then, in make_sort, we add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. So for tokens with the same frequency, their keys would be the same before adding the index term. After adding, they become unique. So when sorted, the tokens with the same frequency would be ordered based on their index, thus preserving the original order.\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is [2,4,2,1]. The histogram is [2,1,1,1]. So the keys after negation are [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, in make_sort, we add min_key=1 * i / max_seq_len=5. So for each position i (0,1,2,3):\n\nkey for i=0: -2 + 0/5 = -2.0\ni=1: -1 + 1/5 = -0.8\ni=2: -1 + 2/5 = -0.6\ni=3: -1 + 3/5 = -0.4\n\nSo the keys are [-2.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be i=0, then i=1, then i=2, then i=3. So the output would be [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, the example expects that the two 2's come first, then 4, then 1. So the order is based on frequency, but when frequencies are the same, the earlier occurrence comes first. So in the input [2,4,2,1], the first 2 is at position 0, the second 2 is at position 2. So when frequencies are the same, the token that appears first in the input should come first in the output.\n\nBut in the current implementation, when we add the index to the key, the earlier index has a smaller key, so it would come first in the sorted order. So for the tokens with the same frequency, their keys after modification would be in the order of their indices. So in the example, the keys after modification for the two 2's (positions 0 and 2) would be -2.0 and (-1 + 2/5) = -0.6. Wait, no: the key for position 0 is -2.0, which is the frequency-based key. For position 2, the key is -1 + 2/5 = -0.6. So when sorted, position 0 comes before position 2 because -2.0 < -0.6. So in the output, the first 2 (position 0) would come before the second 2 (position 2). So the output would be [2 (pos0), 4 (pos1), 2 (pos2), 1 (pos3)], which is [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So that's not correct.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The current implementation in make_sort_freq is using the negative histogram as the key, but when there are multiple tokens with the same frequency, their order in the output is determined by their position in the input. However, the current approach in make_sort() is adding the index to the key, which for the same frequency tokens, the earlier index has a smaller key and thus comes first. But in the example, the two 2's are at positions 0 and 2. So in the output, the first 2 (pos0) comes before the second 2 (pos2), which is correct. But the example expects both 2's to come before 4 and 1. So why is the output [2,2,4,1]?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nIn make_sort_freq, the example is:\n\nsort = make_sort_freq(max_seq_len=5)\nsort([2,4,2,1]) \u2192 [2,2,4,1]\n\nSo the input is [2,4,2,1]. The histogram is [2,1,1,1]. So the frequencies are 2 for 2, and 1 for 4, 2, and 1. So when sorted by frequency in descending order, the 2's should come first, followed by 4, then 1. But in the input, the 4 is at position1, and the second 2 is at position2. So the output should have both 2's first, then 4, then 1. So the output should be [2,2,4,1].\n\nBut according to the current implementation, the keys after modification are:\n\nFor each token:\n\nToken 2 at position0: key = -2 + 0/5 = -2.0\nToken4 at position1: key = -1 +1/5 = -0.8\nToken2 at position2: key = -1 +2/5 = -0.6\nToken1 at position3: key = -1 +3/5 = -0.4\n\nSo when sorted in ascending order, the order is:\n\n-2.0 (pos0), -0.8 (pos1), -0.6 (pos2), -0.4 (pos3)\n\nSo the output would be [2,4,2,1], which doesn't match the example. So the problem is that the current implementation is not grouping the tokens with the same frequency together in the output.\n\nWait, but the current approach is to make the keys unique by adding the index, which breaks the ties. So when frequencies are the same, the tokens are ordered by their index, which is correct. But in the example, the two 2's have the same frequency, so they should appear before the 4 and 1. But in the current implementation, the first 2 is at position0, which comes before the 4 at position1. So the output is [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So the issue is that the second 2 is at position2, which comes after position1. So in the output, the 4 comes before the second 2, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that when frequencies are the same, the tokens should be ordered based on their original positions, but the current implementation is not doing that correctly. Because when we add the index to the key, the earlier index comes first, but in the example, the second 2 is at position2, which is after the 4 at position1. So the 4 comes before the second 2 in the output, which is not desired.\n\nWait, but in the example, the desired output is [2,2,4,1], which means that both 2's come before 4 and 1. So how can we achieve that?\n\nAh, perhaps the issue is that the current implementation is using the index in the key, but when frequencies are the same, the tokens should be ordered based on their original positions, not their indices. Wait, no, the index is the position in the input. So for the same frequency, earlier positions should come first.\n\nWait, in the example, the two 2's are at positions0 and 2. So when sorted, position0 comes before position2. So in the output, the first 2 is at position0, then the 4 at position1, then the second 2 at position2, then 1 at position3. So the output is [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So the current implementation is not producing the desired output.\n\nSo the problem is that the current approach in make_sort_freq is not correctly ordering tokens with the same frequency. The desired behavior is that tokens with the same frequency appear in the same order as they do in the input. So in the example, both 2's should come before 4 and 1, regardless of their positions.\n\nWait, but how can that be achieved? Because when we sort, the keys must be unique to avoid tie-breaking issues. So perhaps the approach of adding the index is correct, but the way the keys are being constructed is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the keys are being constructed as negative histogram plus index. But when the histogram is the same, the index is being added, which makes the key for the second 2 higher than the 4's key. So in the example, the key for the second 2 is -0.6, which is higher than the 4's key of -0.8. So when sorted in ascending order, -0.8 comes before -0.6, so 4 comes before the second 2. That's why the output is [2,4,2,1], but the desired output is [2,2,4,1].\n\nSo to fix this, perhaps the key should be constructed differently. Instead of adding the index, perhaps we should append the index as a secondary key in a way that for the same frequency, the tokens are ordered by their original positions.\n\nWait, but the current approach is to add a small value based on the index, which may not be sufficient because the index could be large enough to affect the sorting order when frequencies are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key should be a tuple where the first element is the negative frequency, and the second element is the index. Then, when sorting, tuples are compared element-wise. So for tokens with the same frequency, the one with the smaller index comes first.\n\nBut in RASP, the keys are numerical, not tuples. So how can we encode this? We need a way to create a key that first sorts by frequency (descending), then by position (ascending).\n\nOne approach is to create a key that is (-frequency) + (index / max_seq_len). This way, for the same frequency, the token with the smaller index will have a smaller key and thus come first in the sorted order.\n\nWait, let's test this. For the example:\n\nToken at position0: frequency 2 \u2192 key = -2 + 0/5 = -2.0\nToken at position1: frequency 1 \u2192 key = -1 + 1/5 = -0.8\nToken at position2: frequency 1 \u2192 key = -1 + 2/5 = -0.6\nToken at position3: frequency 1 \u2192 key = -1 + 3/5 = -0.4\n\nSo when sorted in ascending order, the order is -2.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4. So the output is [2,4,2,1], which is not correct.\n\nBut we want the tokens with the same frequency to be ordered by their original positions. So for the same frequency, the token that appears earlier in the input should come first in the output.\n\nSo in the example, the two 2's are at positions0 and 2. So in the output, both should come before 4 (position1) and 1 (position3). But with the current key, the 4 comes before the second 2 because its key is -0.8, which is higher than -2.0 but lower than -0.6.\n\nWait, no. The keys are:\n\n-2.0 (pos0), -0.8 (pos1), -0.6 (pos2), -0.4 (pos3).\n\nWhen sorted in ascending order, the order is pos0, pos1, pos2, pos3. So the output is [2,4,2,1], but the desired output is [2,2,4,1].\n\nSo the problem is that the 4 (pos1) has a higher key than the second 2 (pos2), so it comes before. But we want the second 2 to come before the 4.\n\nSo perhaps the approach of adding the index is not correct. Instead, for the same frequency, we should sort by the original position in ascending order. So the key should be such that for the same frequency, smaller indices come first.\n\nBut how can we encode this in a single numerical key? One way is to use a primary key of (-frequency) and a secondary key of index, but since we can't have tuples, we can create a key that combines both. For example, key = (-frequency) + (index / max_seq_len). But as we saw, this doesn't solve the problem because the index addition may not be enough to change the order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can multiply the index by a small factor so that it doesn't affect the primary sorting by frequency but ensures that within the same frequency, the order is by index.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the keys are being negated, which reverses the order. So higher frequencies come first. But when adding the index, it's possible that the index addition is making the key of the 4 higher than that of the second 2, causing it to come before.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to adjust the key construction so that for the same frequency, the tokens are ordered by their original positions.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of adding the index, we can subtract it. Or perhaps use a different scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram. So when we pass min_key=1 and max_seq_len=5, the added value is i/5. So for the same frequency, the key is (-freq) + (i/5). So for tokens with the same frequency, the one with smaller i has a smaller key and comes first.\n\nWait, in the example, the two 2's are at i=0 and i=2. So their keys are -2 + 0/5 = -2.0 and -1 + 2/5 = -0.6. Wait, no: the frequency for the 2's is 2, so the key is -2 + 0/5 = -2.0 for the first 2, and for the second 2, the frequency is also 2, so key is -2 + 2/5 = -1.6. Wait, no: in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram. So for each token, the key is -hist[i]. So for the first 2 (i=0), hist[i]=2 \u2192 key=-2. For the second 2 (i=2), hist[i]=1? Wait no, the histogram is the count of each token. So in the input [2,4,2,1], the histogram is [2,1,2,1]. Wait, no: the histogram is calculated as the number of times each token appears. So for each position i, hist[i] is the count of tokens[i] in the entire sequence.\n\nWait, no. The make_hist() function returns an SOp where each element is the count of that token in the entire sequence. So for input [2,4,2,1], the hist would be [2,1,2,1]. So for each position i, hist[i] is the count of tokens[i]. So for i=0, token is 2, count is 2. For i=1, token is4, count is1. For i=2, token is2, count is2. For i=3, token is1, count is1.\n\nSo when we negate the hist, we get [-2, -1, -2, -1]. Then, in make_sort(), we add min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for each i:\n\ni=0: -2 + (1 * 0)/5 = -2.0\ni=1: -1 + (1 *1)/5 = -0.8\ni=2: -2 + (1 *2)/5 = -1.6\ni=3: -1 + (1 *3)/5 = -0.4\n\nSo the keys are [-2.0, -0.8, -1.6, -0.4]. Now, when we sort these keys in ascending order, the order is:\n\n-2.0 (i=0), -1.6 (i=2), -0.8 (i=1), -0.4 (i=3).\n\nSo the output would be [2 (i=0), 2 (i=2),4 (i=1),1 (i=3)], which is [2,2,4,1], matching the example.\n\nWait, that's correct! So why was the earlier analysis giving a different result? Because I think I made a mistake in calculating the keys.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, the hist is [2,1,2,1]. So when negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort(), we add (1 * i)/5 to each key. So for each i:\n\ni=0: -2 + 0 = -2.0\ni=1: -1 + 0.2 = -0.8\ni=2: -2 + 0.4 = -1.6\ni=3: -1 + 0.6 = -0.4\n\nSo the keys are [-2.0, -0.8, -1.6, -0.4]. Sorting these in ascending order gives the order i=0, i=2, i=1, i=3. So the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nSo why did the initial analysis think that the output was [2,4,2,1]? Because I must have miscalculated the keys. So the current implementation is correct, and the example works as intended.\n\nWait, but then why did the initial code have the *-1 in make_sort_unique? That's the bug. Because in make_sort_unique, the return statement is rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1, which would invert the values. So for the example in make_sort_unique, where the input is [2,4,3,1], the output would be [-1,-2,-3,-4], which is incorrect. So that's the bug.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique, where the return statement incorrectly multiplies by -1. That needs to be removed.\n\nSo the steps to repair the code are:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique, remove the *-1 in the return statement.\n2. Verify that all other functions are correct.\n\nSo the corrected code would have:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    ...\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other issues.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq, the hist is correctly calculated as make_hist(), then negated. Then passed to make_sort with the tokens and this hist, along with max_seq_len and min_key=1. That seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to check is the use of rasp.SequenceMap in make_sort(). It's correctly adding the index-based value to the keys to ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo the only bug is the *-1 in make_sort_unique. Once that's fixed, the programs should work correctly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4632, "completion_tokens": 5853, "total_tokens": 10485}}, {"id": "gen-1738410989-eWPlDA5JyCe6jAPzL5hD", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410989, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main correction was in the `make_sort_unique` function where an invalid multiplication was present.

Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count of each token. That seems correct because each element in the output will count how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's an issue here.\n\nNext, looking at `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target position by taking the width of this selector. The idea is that for each position, it counts how many keys are smaller, which gives the target index. Then it creates a selector `sel_new` by comparing `target_pos` with `rasp.indices`, and aggregates `vals` using this selector. However, the return statement multiplies by -1, which doesn't make sense because `rasp.Aggregate` returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. That's a problem. Instead, the aggregation should directly give the sorted values without multiplication.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. This function modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. It then calls `make_sort_unique` with these modified keys. The modification seems correct because adding a small value based on index ensures uniqueness for numerical keys. So this part looks okay.\n\nNow, `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram and negates it to use as sorting keys. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency will have lower negative counts, so sorting in ascending order will place them first. However, when calling `make_sort`, it's passing `hist` as the keys, but `make_sort` expects `keys` to be numerical. Since `hist` is a sequence of counts, this should be fine. But wait, in `make_sort`, the keys are modified by adding `min_key * i / max_seq_len`. Here, `min_key` is set to 1, which is correct for ensuring uniqueness. But in the example, when tokens have the same frequency, their order is preserved. However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly because the added term could disrupt the sorting order. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is correct because the added term is small enough not to affect the primary sorting key, which is the frequency.\n\nWait, another issue: in `make_sort_unique`, the `sel_new` selector is created by comparing `target_pos` (which is a vector of counts) with `rasp.indices`. But `rasp.indices` returns the position indices, starting from 0. So for each element, `target_pos` is the number of elements smaller than it, which is the correct position in a sorted array. So the selector `sel_new` should select exactly one position per row, which is correct for aggregation. But the multiplication by -1 in the return statement is invalid. So I need to remove that.\n\nAnother point: in `make_sort`, the function is named but the parameters might be incorrect. Let me check the function definition. The original code has `def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:`. That looks correct.\n\nWait, in `make_sort_freq`, the function is called as `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)`. But `make_sort` expects `vals` and `keys` as the first two arguments. So `rasp.tokens` is `vals`, and `hist` is `keys`. That makes sense because we're sorting the tokens based on their histogram counts.\n\nSo the main issue is in `make_sort_unique` where the return statement incorrectly multiplies the aggregate by -1. I should remove that multiplication.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n1. In `make_sort_unique`, change `return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\") * -1` to just `return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")`.\n\n2. Check if all functions are correctly using the RASP operations without any invalid steps.\n\nAnother possible issue: in `make_sort`, when modifying the keys, the lambda function is `lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len`. Since `i` is the index starting from 0, adding this term ensures that each key is unique. This should work as intended.\n\nTesting the example in `make_sort_freq`: for input [2,4,2,1], the histogram is [2,1,2,1]. Negating gives [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted, the order should be based on these keys. The smallest key is -2, so the first two elements (positions 0 and 2) will come first, followed by the others. But since the keys are modified with their indices, the sorting should preserve the original order for elements with the same frequency. So the output [2,2,4,1] is correct.\n\nI think that's the main issue. So the corrected code should fix the return statement in `make_sort_unique`.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 1886, "total_tokens": 6509}}, {"id": "gen-1738411064-sjVrgjcg8Wm3bk6EJTdG", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411064, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort_unique` function where the return statement incorrectly multiplied the result by -1.

I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, the return statement has rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1. Oh, that's a problem because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Instead, maybe they intended to reverse the order. So perhaps the Aggregate is being used incorrectly. Instead of multiplying, maybe they should apply a Map with a lambda that negates or uses some other logic. Alternatively, perhaps the selector is incorrect. Let me think: the current setup is trying to get the position where each value should be placed. But the multiplication by -1 doesn't make sense here. So this is a bug.\n\nLooking at make_sort(), it modifies the keys by adding a term based on indices to make them unique. Then calls make_sort_unique. That seems okay, but depends on make_sort_unique working correctly.\n\nmake_sort_freq() uses make_hist to get frequencies, negates them, and then sorts. But since make_sort_unique is broken, this will also be broken.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique. Let me focus on that.\n\nIn make_sort_unique, the goal is to sort vals based on keys. The current approach creates 'smaller' as a selector where each row i has True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. Then target_pos is the count of Trues for each row, which gives the number of keys smaller than key[i]. So target_pos[i] is the rank of key[i], assuming all keys are unique. Then sel_new is a selector where each row i selects the position where target_pos equals the index. So for each i, it's trying to find the position where the rank is i. Then Aggregate uses this selector to pick the corresponding val.\n\nBut the problem is that the Aggregate is being multiplied by -1, which isn't valid. Instead, perhaps the intention was to sort in ascending order, so the current setup might already be correct, but the multiplication is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the selector is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given. When keys are [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector would have rows indicating how many keys are smaller than each key. So for key 2 (index 0), there's 1 (key 1) smaller, so target_pos[0] is 1. For key 4 (index 1), there are 3 smaller, target_pos[1] is 3. For key 3 (index 2), 2 smaller, target_pos[2] is 2. For key 1 (index 3), 0 smaller, target_pos[3] is 0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is a selector where each row i is True only at the position where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, it's True at j=3; i=1, True at j=0; i=2, True at j=2; i=3, True at j=1. So the selector would pick vals in the order [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nBut the return statement is rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals) * -1. That's invalid because Aggregate returns an SOp, and you can't multiply it by -1. So this is a bug. Instead, perhaps the selector is correct, and the multiplication is a mistake. So the correct return should be rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\").\n\nSo the fix is to remove the * -1 part.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become unique. But does this affect the sorting order? Since the added term is small, it shouldn't change the relative order for unique sorting. So that part seems okay.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq(), it's using hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"). But make_hist() returns a count, so negating it would sort in ascending order of frequency. But when you pass this to make_sort(), which sorts by the keys in ascending order, so higher frequency (lower negated count) comes first. Wait, no: if hist is the count, then -hist would be lower for higher counts. So when sorting by -hist in ascending order, higher counts come first. So that's correct.\n\nBut in make_sort_freq(), the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the keys are the negated histogram, and the vals are the tokens. So it should sort the tokens based on their frequency.\n\nBut again, the issue is in make_sort_unique's return statement.\n\nSo to fix the code:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), change the return statement to return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\") without the * -1.\n\n2. Check if there are other issues. For example, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified, but perhaps the way it's done could cause issues. Let me see: keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices). This adds a small value to each key based on its position, ensuring uniqueness. That should be fine as long as min_key is positive and max_seq_len is sufficiently large to prevent overlaps.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort(), the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). Wait, the function expects max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments, but in the example, they are passed positionally. That would cause an error. Oh, right, in the function definition, the parameters after * are keyword-only, so they must be passed as keywords. So the example usage is incorrect. But that's a separate issue, perhaps. However, in the code provided, the function is defined correctly, but the example usage is wrong. But since the task is to repair the RASP program, not the examples, perhaps that's beyond the current scope.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the code, and the task is to repair it. So perhaps the function definitions are correct, but the example usage is wrong. But that's not part of the code to repair.\n\nSo focusing on the code:\n\nThe main issue is the return statement in make_sort_unique. So I'll correct that.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That's correct because make_sort expects max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Fix make_sort_unique() by removing the multiplication by -1.\n\n- Ensure all other functions are correct.\n\nLet me go through each function again.\n\nmake_hist() seems correct.\n\nmake_sort_unique():\n\n- Creates 'smaller' selector correctly.\n\n- target_pos is the count of smaller keys.\n\n- sel_new selects the position where target_pos equals the index.\n\n- Aggregate picks the vals at those positions.\n\n- The return statement was wrong, so fix it.\n\nmake_sort() seems correct except for the example usage, but that's not part of the code.\n\nmake_sort_freq() is correct as long as make_sort_unique is fixed.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort_unique's return statement.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2522, "total_tokens": 7145}}, {"id": "gen-1738411159-rtEu51g5I9vMEAYr9ado", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411159, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and fixed them:\n\n1. **make_sort_unique()**: Removed the invalid multiplication by -1 in the return statement.\n2. **make_sort_freq()**: Replaced the invalid negation of an SOp with a valid `rasp.Map` operation to negate each element.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of this selector, which gives the number of elements smaller than each position. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but the return statement has * -1. Oh, that's a problem because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation in RASP. So that's an error. Instead, maybe the sort isn't correctly ordering, but the multiplication by -1 is incorrect. So I need to remove that.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. Then calls make_sort_unique. The issue is in make_sort_unique's return statement. So I'll fix that by removing the * -1.\n\nThen, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it (so higher frequency comes first), and then sorts using make_sort. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified. However, in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, which might not be necessary. Let me think: when sorting by frequency, higher frequency should come first. So the hist is the count, so when we sort, we want to sort in ascending or descending order? The current code negates hist, so when passed to make_sort, which sorts by < relation, the higher hist (more frequent) would come first because after negation, they are smaller. Wait, no. Let me see: if hist is [2,1,2,1], negated becomes [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to the original tokens [0,2,1,3]. So the sorted output would be [2,2,4,1] as in the example. So that part seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on their position. So that should handle ties correctly.\n\nNow, looking back at make_sort_unique(), the problem is the return statement. It's doing return rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1, which is invalid because Aggregate returns an SOp, and you can't multiply it by a scalar in RASP. So that's incorrect. Instead, the Aggregate should directly return the sorted values. So I should remove the * -1.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort_unique(). Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, but maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again. The make_sort function sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So if we want to sort tokens by frequency in descending order, we need the keys to be such that higher frequency comes first. So negating the hist makes sense because when sorted in ascending order, the more negative values (higher original counts) come first. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the key fix is in make_sort_unique(), removing the multiplication by -1.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the return statement should be rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\"), without the * -1.\n\n2. Ensure that all functions are correctly using the RASP operations without any invalid operations.\n\nLet me check if there are other issues. For example, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified correctly. The lambda in SequenceMap adds min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nAnother point: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is created with make_hist(), which is correct. Then it's negated using rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"hist\"). Wait, no, in the current code, it's hist = -1 * make_hist()... but in RASP, you can't multiply by -1. So that's another error. Oh right, the original code has hist = -1 * make_hist(), which is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar. Instead, it should be a Map operation.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is wrong. It should be hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\"). So that's another bug to fix.\n\nSo now I have two main issues:\n\n1. make_sort_unique() returns an SOp multiplied by -1, which is invalid.\n\n2. make_sort_freq() tries to negate the hist by multiplying by -1, which is also invalid. Instead, it should use a Map to apply the negation.\n\nSo I need to correct both.\n\nLet me go through each function again.\n\nmake_hist() is correct.\n\nmake_sort_unique():\n\n- Creates 'smaller' selector correctly.\n- target_pos is the count of smaller elements, which gives the position where each element should be placed in a sorted list.\n- sel_new selects the correct positions.\n- Aggregate(sel_new, vals) gives the sorted values.\n- The return statement is wrong because of the * -1.

In make_sort_unique(), remove the * -1 in the return statement.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), replace the hist assignment with a Map that negates each element.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nFor make_sort_unique():\n\nreturn rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nNow, I'll update the code accordingly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2227, "total_tokens": 6850}}, {"id": "gen-1738411236-6kiVlmAXelO0n7oPkavw", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411236, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified and fixed several issues in the functions.

That seems correct because it's counting how many times each token appears by checking equality. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The sel_new selector is created by comparing target_pos with indices, and then it aggregates vals using this selector. Wait, but the return statement has rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1. Oh, that's a problem because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation in RASP. So this is incorrect. Instead, the aggregation should directly give the correct order without multiplication. So I need to remove the * -1 part.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding a term to make them unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But looking at the parameters, the function is defined as make_sort(vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). Wait, in the original code, the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp: But in the problem statement, the example usage shows make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which suggests that max_seq_len and min_key are positional arguments. However, in Python, after the * in the function signature, all following arguments must be keyword arguments. So this would cause an error when called positionally. To fix this, I should remove the * and make max_seq_len and min_key keyword arguments with defaults, or adjust the function to accept them positionally.\n\nWait, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), which passes max_seq_len and min_key as positional. So the function should have them as positional parameters, not keyword-only. So I'll change the function signature to have max_seq_len and min_key as regular parameters with default values. For example, def make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> ... .\n\nThen, inside make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But wait, rasp.indices starts at 0, so for each position i, we add a small value to make keys unique. That makes sense.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to use as keys for sorting. Then it calls make_sort with max_seq_len. But in the original code, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But after fixing make_sort's signature, we need to pass max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments. So the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1). Or, if we keep them as keyword arguments, but the function expects them positionally, it would cause an error. So I need to adjust the function call accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), remove the * -1 in the return statement.\n2. Fix the function signature of make_sort() to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional parameters.\n3. Ensure that in make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort passes the arguments correctly.\n\nLet me go through each function step by step.\n\nFor make_sort_unique(), the incorrect line is return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\") * -1. The multiplication is invalid. So it should just return the Aggregate result.\n\nIn make_sort(), the function signature should be def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. This way, when called with positional arguments, it works correctly.\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the call to make_sort should pass max_seq_len and min_key as positional arguments. So it becomes make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1).\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort_freq() function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. Then inside, it calls make_sort with vals=rasp.tokens, keys=hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1. But after changing make_sort's signature, the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, 1).\n\nSo I'll adjust that as well.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n- make_sort_unique(): Remove the * -1.\n- make_sort(): Change the function signature to accept max_seq_len and min_key as positional parameters.\n- make_sort_freq(): Adjust the make_sort call to pass max_seq_len and min_key positionally.\n\nI think that's all.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of this selector, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, the return statement has rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1. Oh, that's a problem because Aggregate returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Instead, maybe they intended to sort in ascending order, so the aggregation should be correct without multiplication. So I'll remove the * -1.\n\nMoving to make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. That makes sense for numerical keys. I don't see issues here.\n\nNow, make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it (so higher frequency comes first?), then uses make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, the example given: input [2,4,2,1] should output [2,2,4,1]. The histogram is [2,1,1,1], so negated it's [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Sorting by these keys would order the first element as the most negative, which is -2, so the first two 2s come first, then 4, then 1. That seems correct. But wait, in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which matches. So the function seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq(), the parameters passed to make_sort are (rasp.tokens, hist, ...). But looking at make_sort's definition, it expects (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So in make_sort_freq, the call should be make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the current code, it's written as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That's correct.\n\nWait, no, the function signature is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So the call in make_sort_freq is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort_freq function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. Then inside, it calls make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). That should be fine.\n\nWait, but looking back, in the original code, the make_sort function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But the parameters are (vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key). So the function expects four arguments, but in the call, it's passing four: vals=rasp.tokens, keys=hist, max_seq_len, min_key. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the make_sort function is defined with a * to indicate that max_seq_len and min_key are keyword-only. So the call in make_sort_freq is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Let me check the return statement in make_sort_unique. The original code returns rasp.Aggregate(...) * -1, which is invalid. So I need to remove that multiplication.\n\nAnother possible issue is in make_sort_freq. When it negates the histogram, it's using -1 * make_hist(). But make_hist returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't allowed. Instead, we should use rasp.Map to negate each element.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, instead of hist = -1 * make_hist(), which is incorrect, we should create hist as make_hist(), then negate it using rasp.Map.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort_freq would be:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as hist = -1 * make_hist(), which is wrong because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. So that's a bug. Instead, we should apply a Map to negate each element.\n\nSo that's another issue to fix.\n\nLet me summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the return statement incorrectly multiplies the Aggregate by -1. This should be removed.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the line hist = -1 * make_hist() is incorrect. Instead, we should use rasp.Map to negate the histogram.\n\nLet me go through each function step by step.\n\nFirst, make_hist() seems correct.\n\nmake_sort_unique():\n\n- Creates 'smaller' selector where each element is True if keys[i] < keys[j].\n- target_pos is the count of Trues for each row, which gives the number of elements smaller than each key.\n- sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the current index.\n- Aggregate selects the corresponding vals. Multiplying by -1 is incorrect. So remove that.\n\nmake_sort():\n\n- Modifies keys to ensure uniqueness by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len.\n- Calls make_sort_unique with the modified keys.\n\nmake_sort_freq():\n\n- Computes histogram (count of each token).\n- Negates the histogram so that higher counts come first.\n- Uses make_sort to sort tokens based on the negated histogram.\n\nBut the negation is done incorrectly. So we need to fix that.\n\nSo the corrected code would be:\n\nIn make_sort_unique, return rasp.Aggregate(...) without the * -1.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, replace hist = -1 * make_hist() with a Map that negates each element.\n\nLet me write the corrected functions.\n\nFor make_sort_unique:\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\nFor make_sort_freq:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist)\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, neg_hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, the make_sort_freq function was defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: and inside it called make_sort with rasp.tokens, hist, etc. So the parameters are correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Since i is the index, which starts from 0, adding this ensures that each key is unique. That makes sense.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected code should fix these two issues.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2425, "total_tokens": 7048}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\") * -1\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
