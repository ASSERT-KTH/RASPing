Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll check each function one by one.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals with this selector. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each key's position in the sorted order is its index. So sel_new would select each position correctly. Then Aggregate should pick the corresponding val. That seems correct. But wait, in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is the sorted keys. But the function is supposed to return the vals sorted by keys. So if vals are the same as keys, it works. But what if vals are different? I think the logic is correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the modified keys would be 2 + 1*0/5=2, 4 +1*1/5=4.2, 3 +1*2/5=3.4, 1 +1*3/5=1.6. Then sorting these would order 1.6, 2, 3.4,4.2, which corresponds to the original order [1,2,3,4]. That makes sense. But wait, the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Oh, because the sort is in ascending order, but the function is using a comparator that checks for LT, which sorts in ascending order. So why multiply by -1? That might be incorrect. Let me think: make_sort_unique returns vals sorted by the keys in ascending order. So if the original function is to sort in ascending order, multiplying by -1 would reverse it, leading to descending order. That's a bug. So the return statement should not multiply by -1. That's probably the issue.\n\nLooking at the example in make_sort: when keys are [2,4,3,1], the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. But if the function returns make_sort_unique(...) * -1, that would reverse the order, giving [4,3,2,1], which is wrong. So the multiplication by -1 is a mistake. It should just return make_sort_unique(vals, keys).\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), it's using make_sort with hist negated. Hist is the frequency count. So negating it would sort tokens by descending frequency. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] should sort to [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the code is correct there.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nSo hist is negated, so when passed to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the tokens will be sorted by their negative frequency, which is descending order of frequency. That's correct because higher frequency comes first. So that part is okay.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where it's multiplying the result by -1, which reverses the order. That's incorrect. So I need to remove that multiplication.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if the keys are not numeric? The function's note says it only works for numerical keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is to fix make_sort() by removing the * -1 in the return statement.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. make_hist() seems correct. make_sort_unique() seems correct. make_sort_freq() is correct as it uses the negated hist to sort in descending frequency.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort(), removing the multiplication by -1.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    ...\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nYes, that's the issue. It should return make_sort_unique(vals, keys), without the * -1.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function would be:\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nI think that's the main fix. Let me see if there are other issues.\n\nWait, in make_sort_unique(), the function is named as make_sort_unique, but in the code, it's called as make_sort_unique(vals, keys). That seems correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort_freq(), the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but the parameters are (vals, keys). So rasp.tokens is vals, hist is keys. That's correct because we're sorting the tokens based on their frequency (hist).\n\nSo the only change is in make_sort().\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2112, "total_tokens": 6735}}, {"id": "gen-1738410395-kwXQsY5umvsDAmlWdI42", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410395, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and fixed them:\n\n1. **Incorrect Multiplication in `make_sort()`**: The function was incorrectly multiplying the result by `-1`, which is invalid.

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll check each function one by one.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct. So `make_hist()` looks fine.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target position by counting how many are smaller, which gives the rank. Then it selects elements where the target position equals the indices and aggregates vals. That should work for unique keys. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. The idea is to make keys unique by adding a small value based on their position. It uses `SequenceMap` to add `min_key * i / max_seq_len` to each key. Then it calls `make_sort_unique` with these modified keys. Wait, but in the function call, it's `make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1`. Oh, wait, no, the function returns an SOp, so multiplying by -1 isn't valid. That's probably a mistake. It should return the result of `make_sort_unique`, not multiply it. So that's an error.\n\nLooking at the example, when `make_sort` is called, it's supposed to sort the values based on the keys. So the mistake is the `* -1` at the end. That line should just return the result of `make_sort_unique`.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses `make_sort` with `hist` as the keys. Wait, `hist` is the negative of the histogram, so sorting by it would order from least frequent to most. But the example shows that the most frequent comes first. Hmm, maybe that's correct because when sorted in ascending order with negative frequencies, higher frequencies come first. Let me think: if hist is -frequency, then sorting by hist in ascending order would arrange from lowest (most negative) to highest (least negative), which corresponds to highest frequency first. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in `make_sort`, the keys are modified by adding `min_key * i / max_seq_len`. So for `make_sort_freq`, the `min_key` is set to 1. So each key (which is the negative histogram value) is adjusted by adding `i/max_seq_len`. That should ensure uniqueness.\n\nBut looking back at `make_sort`, the function is called as `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1)`. Wait, no, in `make_sort_freq`, the call is `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...)`. Wait, no, the parameters are `vals` and `keys`. So in `make_sort_freq`, `vals` is `rasp.tokens` and `keys` is `hist`. So `make_sort` will sort `rasp.tokens` based on `hist` as the keys. Since `hist` is negative frequency, the sorting should arrange tokens from most frequent to least. But the example given is [2,4,2,1] which has frequencies 2,1,2,1. So the sorted output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the `make_sort` function, after modifying the keys, it calls `make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1`. Oh, right, that's the mistake. The `* -1` is incorrect because it's trying to reverse the order, but that's not how SOps work. Instead, perhaps the sorting should be in the correct order without multiplying.\n\nSo the main issue is in `make_sort()`, where the return statement has `* -1`, which is invalid. It should just return the result of `make_sort_unique`.\n\nAnother thing to check: in `make_sort`, the `keys` are being modified by adding a term. But in the function, `keys` is a parameter, and then it's reassigned. That's fine because it's a local variable.\n\nSo the correction is to remove the `* -1` in the return statement of `make_sort`.\n\nLet me also check the function signatures. In `make_sort`, the parameters are `vals`, `keys`, `max_seq_len`, and `min_key`. The function uses `rasp.SequenceMap` correctly to modify the keys. Then it calls `make_sort_unique` with `vals` and the modified `keys`. So that part is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in `make_sort_freq`, the `hist` is created by negating the output of `make_hist()`. Since `make_hist()` returns an SOp, using `* -1` is allowed because SOps support multiplication. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, `hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")` is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. Oh, right, in RASP, to multiply each element by a scalar, you need to use `rasp.Map`. So instead of `-1 * hist`, you should apply a `Map` function.\n\nSo that's another mistake. The line `hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")` is incorrect. It should be `hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist())`.\n\nSo in `make_sort_freq`, the way `hist` is computed is wrong. It should use `rasp.Map` to negate each element instead of multiplying the SOp by -1.\n\nSo now, I have two issues to fix:\n\n1. In `make_sort()`, the return statement incorrectly multiplies by -1. It should just return the `make_sort_unique` result.\n\n2. In `make_sort_freq()`, the `hist` is computed incorrectly. It should use `rasp.Map` to negate each element.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for similar issues.\n\nIn `make_sort_unique`, the `sel_new` is a selector where `target_pos` equals `rasp.indices`. Then it aggregates `vals` using this selector. That should correctly pick the sorted values.\n\nAnother thing: in `make_sort`, the modified keys are passed to `make_sort_unique`, which expects unique keys. By adding the position-based term, the keys become unique, so the function should work.\n\nSo, to summarize the fixes:\n\n- In `make_sort()`, change `return make_sort_unique(...) * -1` to `return make_sort_unique(...)`.\n\n- In `make_sort_freq()`, change `hist = -1 * make_hist()` to `hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist())`.\n\nWait, but looking at the code again, in `make_sort_freq()`, the line is `hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")`. That's incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar. Instead, you must use `rasp.Map`.\n\nSo the corrected code for `make_sort_freq` would be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nThat way, each element of the histogram is negated.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected functions are:\n\n1. `make_sort()` returns the result without multiplying by -1.\n\n2. `make_sort_freq()` computes `hist` using `rasp.Map`.\n\nI think that's the main issues. Let me also check if there are any other potential problems.\n\nIn `make_sort`, the function is supposed to sort in ascending order. By default, `make_sort_unique` sorts based on the keys. So if the keys are modified to be unique, it should sort correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in `make_sort`, the `keys` are modified by adding `min_key * i / max_seq_len`. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on the position. So when two keys are the same, their positions will make them different.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo the final steps are:\n\n- Fix the return statement in `make_sort()`.\n\n- Fix the computation of `hist` in `make_sort_freq()`.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code with these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2612, "total_tokens": 7235}}, {"id": "gen-1738410507-Qe7USJuLwpenEiajkMxL", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410507, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort()` function where the result was incorrectly multiplied by -1, reversing the sorted order.

But in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,0,1,0], right? Because for each position, how many keys are smaller. So for the first element (2), there are three smaller elements (4,3,1? Wait no, wait. Let me think. If keys are [2,4,3,1], then for each key, how many keys are less than it.\n\nWait, for the first key (2), how many keys are less than 2? Looking at all keys, 1 is less than 2. So target_pos for first position is 1. Similarly, for the second key (4), all other keys (2,3,1) are less, so target_pos is 3. Third key (3) has two keys less (2,1), so target_pos is 2. Fourth key (1) has none, so target_pos is 0.\n\nWait, but in the code, 'smaller' is a selector where each row i is True for all j where keys[j] < keys[i]. So the width is the count of Trues in each row, which is the number of keys less than the current key. So target_pos is the count.\n\nThen sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals indices. So for each position i, it's True where target_pos[j] == i. So when we aggregate vals using sel_new, each position i will collect the vals[j] where target_pos[j] == i. Since each key is unique, each i will have exactly one j. So the aggregate will pick that single value, effectively sorting the vals based on the keys.\n\nBut wait, the aggregate function averages the selected values. So if there's only one selected value, it's just that value. So that should work. So make_sort_unique seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique using max_seq_len and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len, where i is the index. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. But wait, in the current code, the keys are being modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then, when passed to make_sort_unique, which sorts in ascending order because it's based on the 'smaller' selector. But in the example, when the keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become unique, and sorting them would arrange them in order. But the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Wait, why multiply by -1? That would reverse the order. Oh, because make_sort_unique sorts in ascending order, but perhaps the original implementation intended to sort in descending order. Or maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the example given for make_sort, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the output is [1,2,3,4], which is ascending order. So why is the function returning make_sort_unique(...) * -1? That would reverse the order, leading to [4,3,2,1], which is not correct. So that's a bug.\n\nSo the problem is in the return statement of make_sort(). It shouldn't multiply by -1. Instead, it should just return the result of make_sort_unique. Because make_sort_unique already sorts the values based on the keys in ascending order. So the multiplication by -1 is incorrect and would reverse the order, which is not desired.\n\nSo to fix make_sort(), I should remove the * -1 part.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, then negates it to get hist. Then it calls make_sort with vals as tokens and keys as hist. The idea is to sort the tokens based on their frequency. But since frequencies are the same for same tokens, adding the index-based modification in make_sort should ensure unique keys, thus preserving the order for tokens with the same frequency.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated. So tokens with higher frequency will have lower hist values. So when sorted in ascending order, higher frequency tokens come first. That makes sense. For example, in [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1]. Negated, it's [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted, the order would be based on these negated hist values. So the tokens with higher frequency (2) come before those with lower (4 and 1). But wait, the example given is [2,4,2,1] which after sorting becomes [2,2,4,1]. So the function seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). So the keys are the negated hist. So when make_sort is called, it will sort the tokens based on these keys. Since the keys are negated, the sorting will be in ascending order of the negated hist, which is descending order of the original hist. So tokens with higher frequency come first. That's correct.\n\nBut the issue is in make_sort(), where the return statement is incorrect. So the main problem is in make_sort() where it returns make_sort_unique(...) * -1, which is wrong.\n\nSo to fix the code, I need to modify the make_sort() function to not multiply by -1.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all functions are using the correct parameters and that there are no other issues.\n\nLooking back, in make_sort(), the parameters are correctly passed. The keys are modified to be unique, then make_sort_unique is called. The only issue is the multiplication by -1, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. In make_sort(), remove the * -1 in the return statement.\n2. Ensure that all other functions are correct.\n\nTesting the example after the fix:\n\nFor make_sort(), when called with [2,4,3,1], the modified keys would be unique, and make_sort_unique would sort them in ascending order, so the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,4,1,2] would have keys modified to unique values, and after sorting, the output is [1,2,2,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort().\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2325, "total_tokens": 6948}}, {"id": "gen-1738410599-L5uHfYD0UINSrAPtwAj1", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410599, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the main issue was in the `make_sort` function where it incorrectly multiplied the result by -1.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. So for each position, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than keys[i]. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. \n\nWait, but when you aggregate, you're selecting the vals where the target_pos matches the index. So for each i, you're taking the value from vals where target_pos[j] == i. That should effectively sort the vals based on the keys because target_pos gives the rank. But I'm not sure if this correctly handles all cases, especially when there are duplicate keys. The comment says it only supports unique keys, so maybe that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding a term based on their position. The formula is x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique because the position index is unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. But wait, the function signature in the original code has a problem. The parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key), but in the function definition, it's written as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. That should be correct.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the original code in the user's message shows that make_sort is called with (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1), but the function definition in the code is:\n\ndef make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nSo that's correct. But in the function, when it calls make_sort_unique, it's passing (vals, keys) after modifying keys. Wait, no, the code does:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(...)\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nYes, that's correct because make_sort_unique expects the modified keys which are unique.\n\nBut then there's a * -1 in the return statement. Wait, no, looking at the code, the return is:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because make_sort_unique returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 would apply a Map. But in the original code, the line is:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nWait, no, looking back, the code shows:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nBut that's incorrect because make_sort_unique returns an SOp, and you can't multiply it by -1 directly. Oh wait, no, in RASP, the SOp objects might support multiplication as a Map operation. Let me check the RASP code provided.\n\nLooking at the RASP code, the SOp class doesn't have __mul__ defined. So multiplying an SOp by a scalar would not work. Therefore, this line is incorrect. It should instead apply a Map to multiply each element by -1.\n\nSo the correct approach would be to return make_sort_unique(vals, keys).named(\"sort\") and then apply a Map to multiply by -1 if needed. But wait, why is there a * -1? Let me think about what make_sort_unique does. It sorts the vals based on the keys in ascending order. If the original code intended to sort in descending order, then multiplying by -1 would reverse it. But that's not the case here because the example shows [2,4,3,1] becomes [1,2,3,4], which is ascending. So perhaps the * -1 is a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the example in make_sort:\n\nsort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\nsort([2, 4, 3, 1]) returns [1,2,3,4]\n\nSo the function is supposed to sort in ascending order. Therefore, the * -1 is incorrect because it would reverse the order. So that line is a bug. It should just return make_sort_unique(vals, keys).\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function should not have the * -1.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, multiplies by -1, and then uses make_sort with hist as the key. Wait, hist is the count of each token. Multiplying by -1 would sort in descending order of frequency. So tokens with higher frequency come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] becomes [2,2,4,1], which is correct because 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorting is based on frequency descending, but stable for same frequencies.\n\nWait, but in the code, hist is computed as make_hist(), then multiplied by -1. So hist is [2,1,2,1] for \"abac\", then -1 * hist would be [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, when used as keys in make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the tokens with lower (more negative) hist values come first. Wait, no: the keys are the hist values, and make_sort sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So for example, if the hist is [2,1,2,1], the keys after *-1 are [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Sorting in ascending order would arrange the tokens based on these keys. So the order would be the tokens with key -2, then -1. But wait, in the example given in make_sort_freq, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the tokens are sorted by frequency descending. So perhaps using make_sort with the negative hist as keys would achieve that because make_sort sorts in ascending order, so the most negative (highest frequency) comes first.\n\nWait, let's think: the hist for [2,4,2,1] is [2,1,2,1]. So the keys after multiplying by -1 are [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1. So the corresponding tokens would be 2,2,4,1, which matches the example. So that part is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the make_sort_freq function is defined as:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but the make_sort function expects 'vals' and 'keys' as the first two arguments. In this case, 'vals' is rasp.tokens, and 'keys' is hist. So when make_sort is called, it will sort the tokens based on the hist values. But since hist is the frequency, and we want to sort tokens in descending order of frequency, using the negative hist as keys and sorting in ascending order (which is what make_sort does) is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the make_sort function, after modifying the keys to be unique, it calls make_sort_unique, which sorts in ascending order based on the modified keys. So the tokens are arranged from smallest to largest based on their modified keys. Since the modified keys are the original keys plus a small term, the sorting is stable for equal keys.\n\nSo the issue is in the make_sort function where it returns make_sort_unique(...) * -1, which is incorrect. So I need to fix that.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), which is correct because 'vals' is the tokens, and 'keys' is the hist. So that part is okay.\n\nWait, but looking at the function definitions again:\n\nmake_sort_unique(vals, keys) returns the sorted vals based on keys.\n\nmake_sort() modifies the keys to be unique and then calls make_sort_unique.\n\nSo in make_sort_freq, the keys are the hist (frequency), and after multiplying by -1, they are used as the keys for sorting. So the tokens are sorted in ascending order of their negative frequency, which is equivalent to descending order of frequency.\n\nSo the main bug is in the make_sort function where it returns make_sort_unique(...) * -1. That's incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. Instead, if the intention was to reverse the order, perhaps the keys should be multiplied by -1 before sorting. But in this case, the make_sort function is supposed to sort in ascending order. So the * -1 is a mistake and should be removed.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function should return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) without the multiplication.\n\nAnother possible issue: in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that each key is unique by adding a small value based on the position. However, when the keys are negative, this might cause issues. But since the function is intended for numerical keys, it should be okay.\n\nWait, but in the make_sort function, the keys are modified as x + min_key * i / max_seq_len. Let me see: for each position i, the key is increased by (min_key * i) / max_seq_len. So for i=0, it's x + 0, i=1, x + min_key / max_seq_len, etc. This ensures that each key is unique because each position adds a unique value. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1. So when the keys are the hist (frequency), which can be zero or positive, adding 1 * i / max_seq_len ensures that the keys are unique. But wait, the hist can be zero? No, because the histogram counts occurrences, so it's at least 1 for each token. So adding the term would make each key unique.\n\nWait, no: the histogram for a token that doesn't appear is zero? No, because in the example, the tokens are the input, so each token in the input appears at least once. So the hist is at least 1 for each position. So adding the term would make each key unique.\n\nSo the main issue is the * -1 in make_sort. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the return statement incorrectly multiplies the result by -1, which is not a valid operation. It should be removed.\n\n2. All other functions seem correct.\n\nSo the corrected code would involve removing the * -1 in make_sort().\n\nLet me write the corrected functions.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3181, "total_tokens": 7804}}, {"id": "gen-1738410685-WVQiCfIlGi9Lo5j4f6t0", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410685, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was variable shadowing in the `make_sort` function.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each index exactly once. That should correctly sort the values. Hmm, maybe this is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. But wait, the function signature in the original code is def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example usage, the function is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the parameters are correctly passed. However, in the code, the keys are being reassigned. That might cause issues because the original keys parameter is being overwritten. Oh, right, because in Python, assigning to a parameter inside the function can cause unexpected behavior, especially if the function is called multiple times or if there are closures involved. So this is a problem. We should rename the modified keys variable to something else, like 'unique_keys', to avoid overwriting the original 'keys' parameter.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as the key. Wait, the example shows that tokens are sorted by frequency, so higher frequency comes first. But in the code, hist is negated, so when passed to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, the tokens with higher frequency (more negative hist) would come first. That makes sense. But let me check the parameters. The function is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:. But in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(5), which is correct. However, in the code, when calling make_sort, it's using hist as the second argument. Wait, the make_sort function expects 'vals' and 'keys' as the first two arguments. In make_sort_freq, it's passing rasp.tokens as vals and hist as keys. That's correct because we're sorting the tokens based on their frequency. So that part seems okay.\n\nWait, but looking back at make_sort(), the function is supposed to sort the 'vals' based on the 'keys'. So in make_sort_freq, 'vals' is rasp.tokens, and 'keys' is the negated histogram. So the tokens will be sorted in the order of increasing keys, which is increasing negated histogram, meaning decreasing actual histogram. So higher frequency tokens come first. That's correct.\n\nBut let me check the parameters again. The make_sort function in the original code is called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). So 'vals' is tokens, 'keys' is hist. Then, inside make_sort, 'keys' is reassigned. Oh, that's the problem. Because in the function definition, 'keys' is a parameter, and then it's being reassigned, which could cause issues. So I should change that variable name.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the 'keys' parameter is being overwritten. Let me fix that by renaming the modified keys to 'unique_keys'.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But wait, 'i' comes from rasp.indices, which starts at 0. So for each position, we add a small value based on its index. This ensures that each key is unique, which is necessary for make_sort_unique to work correctly.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the keys are being reassigned. So the function should create a new variable instead of overwriting 'keys'. So I'll change that part.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\n1. In make_sort(), rename the modified keys variable to avoid overwriting the parameter.\n2. Ensure that all functions are correctly using the parameters without any variable shadowing.\n\nSo, in make_sort(), the code should be:\n\nunique_keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, unique_keys)\n\nThis way, the original 'keys' parameter is not overwritten, and the code should function correctly.\n\nI think that's the main issue. Let me check the other functions again. make_hist() and make_sort_unique() seem correct. make_sort_freq() is using the correct parameters.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the original code, the make_sort() function returns make_sort_unique with 'keys' being the modified unique_keys. So that should be correct after the renaming.\n\nSo the corrected code would involve renaming 'keys' to 'unique_keys' in make_sort() to prevent overwriting the parameter. That should fix any issues related to variable scope or unexpected behavior.\n\nI'll proceed to write the corrected code with this change.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2022, "total_tokens": 6645}}, {"id": "gen-1738410746-ejL3QEJ7mSmNUzMBCFqF", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410746, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and fixed them:\n\n1. **Incorrect Return Statement in `make_sort()`**: The function was incorrectly returning the result of `make_sort_unique()` multiplied by -1, which is not a valid operation.

Let me look through the code and see where the issues might be.\n\nFirst, I'll check each function one by one.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's an issue here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each key, how many are smaller. Then sel_new would select the position where the index matches target_pos. So for the first element, target_pos is 3, so it selects index 3, which is 1. That makes sense. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It takes vals, keys, max_seq_len, and min_key. It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len, where i is the index. This is to make keys unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, each key gets a small addition based on their index. So the keys become unique, allowing the sort to work correctly. But looking at the code, the return statement is 'return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1'. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because make_sort_unique returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Oh, I see, that's a mistake. The code should return the result of make_sort_unique, not multiply it. So that's an error.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses make_sort with hist as keys. The idea is that higher frequency tokens come first because their negative hist is smaller. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. However, in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1. So for each token, the key becomes -hist + 1 * i / max_seq_len. This ensures that tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original positions. That makes sense. But I need to check if the way make_sort is called here is correct.\n\nWait, in make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1). But looking at make_sort's parameters, it's defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So the function expects vals and keys, and then the other parameters are keyword-only. So the call seems correct.\n\nBut the main issue is in make_sort(), where it returns make_sort_unique(...) * -1, which is invalid. Instead, it should just return the result. So that line needs to be fixed.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Is this the correct way to ensure uniqueness? Yes, because each position adds a unique value, making each key unique.\n\nSo the main problem is in make_sort(), where the return statement is incorrect. Instead of multiplying by -1, it should just return the SOp from make_sort_unique.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any possible issues. In make_sort_unique(), the 'sel_new' is created with rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Then Aggregate is used to select the vals where the selector is true. That should correctly pick the right value for each position.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), after modifying the keys, it calls make_sort_unique with (vals, keys). But make_sort_unique returns a sorted SOp. So the return statement should just be 'return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)', without any multiplication. The current code has '* -1' which is wrong.\n\nSo the fix is to remove the '* -1' part in make_sort(). That should correct the function.\n\nI should also ensure that all functions are using the correct RASP operations and that there are no other syntax errors. For example, in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated with '-1 *', which is done via a Map. Wait, no, in the code, hist is assigned as -1 * make_hist().named(...), but in RASP, you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar directly. Oh wait, looking at the code, the line is 'hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")'. That's incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. Instead, you should use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that multiplies each element by -1.\n\nSo that's another issue. The current code tries to negate the histogram by multiplying by -1, which isn't valid in RASP. Instead, it should use rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist_sop).\n\nSo in make_sort_freq(), the line should be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\"))\n\nThat way, each element of the histogram is negated correctly.\n\nSo now, I have two main issues to fix:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the return statement is incorrect. It should return make_sort_unique(...) without multiplying by -1.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the negation of the histogram is done incorrectly. It should use rasp.Map to apply a lambda that negates each element.\n\nLet me also check if there are any other issues.\n\nLooking at make_sort_unique(), the 'sel_new' is created as rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Then Aggregate is used to get vals where the selector is true. That should correctly pick the value at the target position. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Since i is the index (starting from 0), this adds a unique value to each key, ensuring that all keys are unique. That makes the sorting stable and allows make_sort_unique to work correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize the fixes:\n\n- In make_sort(), change the return statement to return make_sort_unique(vals, keys).\n\n- In make_sort_freq(), replace the line 'hist = -1 * make_hist()' with a rasp.Map that negates each element.\n\nLet me write down the corrected code.\n\nFor make_sort():\n\nOld code:\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nNew code:\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n\nOld code:\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nNew code:\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist().named(\"hist\"))\n\nWait, but in the original code, the line is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nWhich is incorrect because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar. So the correct way is to use Map.\n\nSo after making these changes, the code should work correctly.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure there are no other issues. For example, in make_sort_freq(), after negating the histogram, the make_sort function is called with hist as keys. Since the hist is negated, the sorting will be in ascending order of the negated hist, which is descending order of the original hist. So tokens with higher frequency come first, which is correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the final code will have these two corrections.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2508, "total_tokens": 7131}}, {"id": "gen-1738410827-52w6wJlykt05xCD7UZY7", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410827, "choices": [{"error": {"message": "Exception: Chunk too big", "code": 502, "metadata": {"provider_name": "DeepInfra", "raw": {"error_type": "unknown_error", "error_message": "Exception: Chunk too big"}}}, "logprobs": null, "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program.

It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's an issue here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,0,1,2], right? Because for each key, how many keys are smaller. So for 2, there are 3 smaller (1,3,4?), no, wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Hmm, maybe the logic is correct. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique with these keys. But wait, the function signature is def make_sort(vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, it's called as make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So that's correct. But in the code, the first line inside make_sort is keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...). But wait, the parameters are vals and keys, and then the function immediately redefines keys. That's fine, but perhaps the parameter names are confusing. Also, the return statement is return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Wait, multiplying by -1? That doesn't make sense because make_sort_unique returns an SOp, which when multiplied by a scalar might not be the intended operation. Oh, wait, perhaps the idea is to sort in ascending order, so using the negative of the keys. But in RASP, how does multiplication work? Because SOp might not support being multiplied by a scalar. Looking back at the RASP code, the Map function applies a function element-wise. So perhaps the code should apply a Map with a lambda that multiplies by -1. So instead of keys = ..., and then return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1, which is incorrect, it should be something like return make_sort_unique(vals, -keys). But how to negate the keys.\n\nWait, in the code, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Then, when passed to make_sort_unique, which sorts based on the keys. So if the original keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become [2 + 1*0/5, 4 +1*1/5, 3 +1*2/5, 1 +1*3/5] which is [2, 4.2, 3.4, 1.6]. Then, when sorted, the order would be 1.6, 2, 3.4, 4.2, which corresponds to the original indices 3,0,2,1. So the sorted vals would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct. But the return statement is multiplying by -1, which doesn't make sense. So that's a bug. Instead, the function should return the result of make_sort_unique without multiplying. Or perhaps the function is trying to sort in ascending order, but the way it's done is incorrect.\n\nWait, the make_sort_unique function returns vals sorted by the keys in ascending order. So if the keys are modified to be unique, the sorting should work. But the return statement is return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1, which is wrong because you can't multiply an SOp by a scalar like that. Instead, perhaps the function should return the SOp directly. So that line is incorrect and needs to be fixed.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, then negates it, and uses it as the key for sorting. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] has hist [2,1,1,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these keys. But wait, when using make_sort(), it sorts based on the keys in ascending order. So the most negative (smallest) comes first. So for -hist, the token with frequency 2 (hist 2, -2) would come before those with hist 1 (-1). So in the example, the sorted order would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct. But the make_sort() function is called with hist as the key, but in the code, it's make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). Wait, no, in make_sort_freq(), hist is computed as -1 * make_hist(), so hist is an SOp. Then, make_sort is called with vals=rasp.tokens, keys=hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1. So that should be correct. But wait, in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index / max_seq_len. So for each key (which is -hist), we add 1 * i / max_seq_len. So for example, if two tokens have the same frequency, their keys would be the same, but after adding the index-based value, they become unique. So that should handle the tie-breaking correctly.\n\nBut the main issue is in make_sort(), where the return statement is incorrect. It should not multiply by -1. So that's a bug.\n\nAnother possible issue is in make_sort_unique(). Let's think about how it works. The 'smaller' selector is created by checking if each key is less than another. So for each position i, 'smaller' selector's row i has True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. Then, target_pos is the count of Trues in each row, which is the number of elements smaller than key[i]. So when we create sel_new as the selector where target_pos equals the indices, that would select the position where the count of smaller elements is equal to the index. Then, when we aggregate vals using sel_new, each position i would get the value from the position where the count of smaller elements is i. That should correctly sort the values in ascending order. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the example where keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [3,0,1,2]. So for each i:\n\ni=0: key=2, number of keys smaller than 2 is 1 (only key 1). So target_pos[0] should be 1, not 3. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the 'smaller' selector is built.\n\nWait, the 'smaller' selector is created as Select(keys, keys, LT). So for each i, j, it's True if keys[j] < keys[i]. So row i has True for all j where key[j] < key[i]. So the count (target_pos[i]) is the number of elements less than key[i]. So for the example [2,4,3,1], the keys are [2,4,3,1].\n\nFor i=0, key=2: how many keys are less than 2? Only key at i=3 (1). So target_pos[0] =1.\n\ni=1, key=4: all other keys (2,3,1) are less than 4. So target_pos[1]=3.\n\ni=2, key=3: keys less than 3 are 2 and 1. So target_pos=2.\n\ni=3, key=1: no keys are less than 1. So target_pos=0.\n\nSo target_pos is [1,3,2,0].\n\nThen, sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). So for each i, it's True where target_pos[i] == j (indices are [0,1,2,3]).\n\nSo for each row i in sel_new, it's looking for j where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nSo for i=0: target_pos[0]=1, so j=1 is True.\n\ni=1: target_pos=3, j=3.\n\ni=2: target_pos=2, j=2.\n\ni=3: target_pos=0, j=0.\n\nSo sel_new is a selector where each row i has a single True at position j = target_pos[i].\n\nWhen we aggregate vals using sel_new, each position i will take the value from j where sel_new[i,j] is True. So the output will be [vals[1], vals[3], vals[2], vals[0]].\n\nWait, in the example, the input is [2,4,3,1]. So vals are [2,4,3,1]. So the output would be [4,1,3,2], which is not sorted. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps the logic in make_sort_unique is incorrect.\n\nWait, the goal is to sort the vals in ascending order based on the keys. So for keys [2,4,3,1], the sorted order should be [1,2,3,4], which corresponds to the vals [1,2,3,4]. But according to the current logic, the output is [4,1,3,2], which is incorrect.\n\nSo there's a bug in make_sort_unique(). The way the selector is built is not correctly capturing the desired order.\n\nLet me think again. The target_pos is the number of elements smaller than each key. So for the keys [2,4,3,1], target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So the desired order is to place each element at position target_pos[i]. But in the current setup, the sel_new selector is matching target_pos[i] to the index j. So for each i, the new position i will get the value from j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, no. The Aggregate function uses the selector to select elements from the sop (vals) and aggregate them. So for each row i in the selector, it's looking for all j where sel_new[i,j] is True, and then aggregates (in this case, since each row has one True, it's just taking that value).\n\nSo for sel_new, each row i has a single True at j = target_pos[i]. So when we aggregate, the output at position i is vals[j] where j is target_pos[i].\n\nWait, no. The Aggregate function takes the selector and the sop. For each i, it looks at the i-th row of the selector, and for each j where selector[i,j] is True, it takes sop[j], and averages them (but since it's a single value, it's just that value). So the output at i is sop[j] where j is the index where selector[i,j] is True.\n\nIn the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for each i:\n\ni=0: selector[0,j] is True at j=1. So output[0] = vals[1] =4.\n\ni=1: selector[1,j] is True at j=3. So output[1] = vals[3] =1.\n\ni=2: selector[2,j] is True at j=2. So output[2] = vals[2] =3.\n\ni=3: selector[3,j] is True at j=0. So output[3] = vals[0] =2.\n\nSo the output is [4,1,3,2], which is not the sorted order. So the function is not working as intended.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the make_sort_unique function is incorrect. It's not producing the correct order.\n\nSo what's wrong with the approach? The idea was that target_pos[i] is the number of elements smaller than key[i], which would be the position where key[i] should be placed in the sorted array. But the current implementation is placing the value at position target_pos[i], but that's not correct because the indices are not necessarily in the right order.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the selector is built incorrectly. Instead of selecting where target_pos[i] == j, perhaps it should be the other way around. Or perhaps the approach to create the selector is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: To sort, each element in the output should be the element from the input whose key is the i-th smallest. So for each i, find the j where key[j] is the i-th smallest, and output vals[j].\n\nSo to create a selector where for each i, the j-th position is True if j is the index of the i-th smallest key.\n\nBut how to construct that selector.\n\nAnother idea: The target_pos for each j is the number of elements smaller than key[j]. So for the sorted order, the first element (i=0) should be the j with target_pos[j] =0, the second (i=1) should be the j with target_pos[j]=1, and so on.\n\nSo the selector should have True at (i,j) where target_pos[j] ==i.\n\nSo in the example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for i=0, j=3 (target_pos[j]=0). For i=1, j=0 (target_pos[j]=1). For i=2, j=2 (target_pos[j]=2). For i=3, j=1 (target_pos[j]=3). So the selector would be:\n\ni=0: j=3 \u2192 True\ni=1: j=0 \u2192 True\ni=2: j=2 \u2192 True\ni=3: j=1 \u2192 True\n\nSo the selector is:\n\n[ [F,F,F,T],\n  [T,F,F,F],\n  [F,F,T,F],\n  [F,T,F,F] ]\n\nThen, when we aggregate, each i will take vals[j] where j is the column with True in row i. So output would be [vals[3], vals[0], vals[2], vals[1]] \u2192 [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the problem is that in the current code, the selector is built as Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), which for each i, selects j where target_pos[i] == j. But that's not correct because j is the index, and we need to select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo instead of Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), it should be Select(indices, target_pos, EQ), because we want j such that target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the selector is built as Select(fst, snd, predicate). So for each pair (fst_elem, snd_elem), it's True if predicate(fst_elem, snd_elem) is True.\n\nIn the current code, sel_new is Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). So for each i (row), j (column), it's True if target_pos[i] == j.\n\nBut we need it to be True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo to achieve that, we need to swap the roles. So the selector should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each i (row), j (column), it's True if indices[j] == target_pos[i]. Wait, no. Because indices is [0,1,2,3], and for each j, indices[j] is j. So for each i, we want j where target_pos[j] == i. So the selector should be True when target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo the selector should be built as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos is the target_pos vector. So for each i, the row i will have True at j where j == target_pos[i]. Wait, no, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe current code:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nThis creates a selector where for row i, column j is True if target_pos[i] == j.\n\nBut what we need is for row i, column j is True if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo to get that, we need to swap the order. So the selector should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos is a vector where target_pos[j] is the target position for j. So for row i, column j is True if j == target_pos[i]. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to create a selector where for each i, j is selected if target_pos[j] == i. So for each j, if target_pos[j] is i, then in row i, column j is True.\n\nSo to create this, we can use Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos is the vector. So for each j, if target_pos[j] == i, then in row i, column j is True.\n\nWait, no. Because the Select function compares the elements of the first SOp (fst) and the second SOp (snd). So for each pair (fst_elem, snd_elem), it's True if fst_elem == snd_elem.\n\nSo if we have fst as rasp.indices (which is [0,1,2,3]) and snd as target_pos (which is [1,3,2,0]), then for each j, fst[j] is j, snd[j] is target_pos[j]. So the comparison is j == target_pos[j]. Which is only True where j equals target_pos[j]. That's not what we want.\n\nWe need, for each i, to find all j where target_pos[j] == i. So for each i, the row i should have True at j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo how can we construct this selector?\n\nAlternative approach: Create a new SOp that represents the target positions, then use Select with rasp.indices and this SOp.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to create an SOp that is target_pos, and then use Select with rasp.indices and this SOp, using EQ.\n\nBut in the current code, target_pos is an SOp, so we can do:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWait, no. Because rasp.indices is [0,1,2,3], and target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos[j] is the target position for j. So the selector will have True where j == target_pos[j], which is only for j where target_pos[j] == j. That's not what we need.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should create a new SOp that is the target_pos, and then for each i, select the j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, perhaps using rasp.SequenceMap to create a new SOp where each element is i if target_pos[j] == i. But that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current selector is transposed. So instead of selecting rows as i and columns as j where target_pos[i] == j, we need to select rows as i and columns as j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo to get that, perhaps we can use the transpose of the current selector. But RASP doesn't have a transpose operation.\n\nAnother idea: The current selector is sel_new = Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). This gives a selector where row i has True at j = target_pos[i]. But we need a selector where row i has True at j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo perhaps we can create a new selector by swapping the order. Instead of Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), we can create a new SOp that is the indices, and then select against target_pos.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct selector is Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos is the target_pos vector. So for each j, if j == target_pos[j], then it's True. But that's not what we need.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the desired selector. For each i, we want to select the j where target_pos[j] == i. So for each i, the selector's row i should have True at column j if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo to create this, we can use Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos[j] is the target position for j. So for each j, if j == target_pos[j], then it's True. But that's only for the case where j is the target position for j, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for j=0, target_pos[j]=1. So in row i=1, we want j=0 to be True. So the selector should have True at (1,0). How can we achieve that?\n\nThe selector is created by comparing two SOps element-wise. So if we have fst as target_pos and snd as rasp.indices, then for each j, fst[j] is target_pos[j], snd[j] is j. So the comparison is target_pos[j] == j. That's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if we have fst as rasp.indices and snd as target_pos, then for each j, fst[j] is j, snd[j] is target_pos[j]. So the comparison is j == target_pos[j]. Again, not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach of using target_pos and indices is not the right way. Maybe we need a different method to create the selector.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of using target_pos, perhaps we can create a selector that directly represents the desired order. For example, for each i, the j that should be in position i is the j with the i-th smallest key.\n\nBut how to construct that selector.\n\nAnother idea: The number of elements smaller than key[j] is target_pos[j]. So for the sorted order, the first element (i=0) should be the j with target_pos[j]=0, the second (i=1) the j with target_pos[j]=1, etc.\n\nSo the desired j for each i is the j where target_pos[j] = i.\n\nSo to create a selector where for each i, the j with target_pos[j] = i is selected.\n\nSo how can we create such a selector?\n\nPerhaps using rasp.Select with target_pos and rasp.indices, but arranged correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the selector should be created as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Because for each j, rasp.indices[j] is j, and target_pos[j] is the target position. So for each j, if j == target_pos[j], then it's True. But that's only for the case where j is the target position for j, which is not the case in our example.\n\nWait, in our example, target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So for j=0, target_pos[j]=1. So in row i=1, we want j=0 to be True. So how can we make that happen.\n\nAh, perhaps the selector should be built as Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). Because for each i, target_pos[i] is the desired j. So row i will have True at j = target_pos[i]. So in our example, row 0 has j=1, row 1 has j=3, row 2 has j=2, row 3 has j=0.\n\nSo the selector is:\n\nRow 0: [F, T, F, F]\n\nRow 1: [F, F, F, T]\n\nRow 2: [F, F, T, F]\n\nRow 3: [T, F, F, F]\n\nThen, when we aggregate, each i will take vals[j] where j is target_pos[i]. So for i=0, j=1 \u2192 vals[1]=4; i=1, j=3 \u2192 vals[3]=1; i=2, j=2 \u2192 vals[2]=3; i=3, j=0 \u2192 vals[0]=2. So the output is [4,1,3,2], which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the current selector is selecting the wrong j for each i. Instead of selecting j where target_pos[j] == i, it's selecting j where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nSo to fix this, we need to create a selector where for each i, j is selected if target_pos[j] == i.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nPerhaps by using the transpose of the current selector, but RASP doesn't support transposes. So we need another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Create an SOp that represents the inverse of target_pos. For each i, find j such that target_pos[j] = i. Then, create a selector where for each i, j is selected if j is in this inverse mapping.\n\nBut how to create this inverse mapping.\n\nAnother approach: Use rasp.SequenceMap to create a new SOp where each element is i if target_pos[j] == i. But that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use rasp.Select with target_pos and an SOp that is rasp.indices, but in a way that for each j, target_pos[j] is compared to i.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to create a new SOp that is the indices, and then for each i, select j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\ninverse_target = rasp.Map(lambda x: x, target_pos)  # Not sure if needed\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(inverse_target, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nWait, no. Because inverse_target is the same as target_pos. So for each j, inverse_target[j] is target_pos[j]. So the selector would be True where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nWait, no. Because in the Select function, for each j, it's comparing the elements of the first SOp (inverse_target) and the second SOp (rasp.indices). So for each j, it's comparing target_pos[j] with j. That's not what we want.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: The desired selector is such that for each i, the selected j is the one where target_pos[j] == i. So for each i, we need to find all j where target_pos[j] == i.\n\nSo, for each i, create a condition that target_pos[j] == i, and then create a selector where row i has True at those j's.\n\nBut how to express this in RASP.\n\nWait, perhaps using rasp.Select with target_pos as the keys and an SOp that is a constant i for each row. But RASP doesn't support creating such an SOp directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create an SOp that represents the"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4632, "completion_tokens": 5859, "total_tokens": 10491}}, {"id": "gen-1738410999-CBWxFYQrzY9cqOUibLCQ", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410999, "choices": [{"error": {"message": "Exception: Chunk too big", "code": 502, "metadata": {"provider_name": "DeepInfra", "raw": {"error_type": "unknown_error", "error_message": "Exception: Chunk too big"}}}, "logprobs": null, "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and addressed them as follows:\n\n1. **make_sort() Function**: The return statement incorrectly multiplied the result by -1, which was removed to fix the output.\n2. **make_sort_freq() Function**: The keys were not correctly computed to ensure same-frequency tokens are sorted by their original positions. We modified the key computation to include both the negative histogram and an index-based term.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each index exactly once. Then Aggregate should pick the corresponding val. That seems correct. But maybe there's an issue with how the aggregation is done. Oh, wait, the default is None, but in the example, it's expected to return the sorted list without any Nones. So perhaps the Aggregate is correctly using the default as None, but in the example, all positions are filled. So maybe this function is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key, where i is the index. This is to ensure uniqueness. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. Wait, but in the function signature, the parameters are (vals, keys, *, max_seq_len, min_key). But in the example usage, when make_sort is called, it's passed (rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1). So the function seems correct. But wait, the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Wait, no, the code shows it returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) multiplied by -1. But make_sort_unique returns an SOp, and you can't multiply it by -1. That's probably an error. Oh, right, the code has a typo. It should be returning the result of make_sort_unique, not multiplying. So that's a bug. So the line should be 'return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)' without the * -1.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the code says 'return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1'. That's incorrect because make_sort_unique returns an SOp, and multiplying it by -1 isn't valid. So that's a mistake. So the correct line should just return make_sort_unique(vals, keys).\n\nWait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the modified keys would be [2 + 1*0/5, 4 +1*1/5, 3 +1*2/5, 1 +1*3/5] which are 2, 4.2, 3.4, 1.6. Sorting these would order 1.6, 2, 3.4, 4.2, which corresponds to the original indices 3,0,2,1. So the sorted vals would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct. So the function is correct except for the multiplication by -1, which is a typo.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the return statement is wrong. It should not multiply by -1. So that's one bug to fix.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, then negates it to get hist. Then it calls make_sort with vals as tokens, keys as hist, and the max_seq_len. But wait, in make_sort, the function expects 'keys' to be the keys for sorting. So in this case, the keys are the negative histogram counts. So when sorted in ascending order, tokens with higher frequency will come first because their keys are more negative. But wait, the make_sort function sorts by the '<' relation on keys. So if the keys are -hist, then higher hist (more frequent) will have smaller keys, so they will be sorted first. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example, [2,4,2,1] has hist [2,1,1,1]. So hist is [2,1,1,1], then -hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. When sorted by these keys, the order would be 0 (key -2), then 1,2,3 (keys -1). So the output is [2,4,2,1], but wait, the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the current approach would sort all the -1 keys after the -2, but among the -1 keys, their original order is preserved because make_sort_unique uses the '<' relation and the keys are unique. Wait, no, because in make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram, and then in make_sort, these keys are further modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So for the example, the keys after modification would be:\n\nOriginal tokens: [2,4,2,1]\nhist: [2,1,1,1]\nneg_hist: [-2,-1,-1,-1]\nThen, in make_sort, keys = neg_hist + 1 * i / max_seq_len. Let's say max_seq_len is 4.\n\nSo for each position i (0-based):\n\ni=0: -2 + (1*0)/4 = -2.0\ni=1: -1 + (1*1)/4 = -0.75\ni=2: -1 + (1*2)/4 = -0.5\ni=3: -1 + (1*3)/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the modified keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25]. When sorted in ascending order, the order is 0,1,2,3. So the sorted tokens would be [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So that's not matching. So the problem is that the current approach in make_sort_freq isn't correctly grouping the tokens with the same frequency.\n\nWait, the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram, but when passed to make_sort, which further modifies the keys by adding index-based values, the sorting might not group the same frequency tokens correctly. Because the added index-based term makes each key unique, but the sorting is based on these unique keys, so the order among same-frequency tokens is determined by their original positions. But in the example, the two 2's are at positions 0 and 2. So their modified keys would be -2.0 and (-1 + 2/4) = -0.5. So in the sorted order, position 0 comes first, then position 2, then 1 and 3. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct. Wait, but according to the modified keys, the order would be 0 (-2.0), 2 (-0.5), 1 (-0.75), 3 (-0.25). Wait, no, because -0.75 is less than -0.5, so the order would be 0,1,2,3. So the sorted tokens would be [2,4,2,1], which is not what the example expects.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the current implementation of make_sort_freq isn't correctly handling the case where multiple tokens have the same frequency. The example expects that tokens with the same frequency appear in the same order as in the input. But with the current approach, the sorting is based on the modified keys, which may not preserve the original order among same-frequency tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the way the keys are constructed isn't correctly ensuring that tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original positions. So when frequencies are the same, the sort should maintain the original order. But the current approach in make_sort() adds the index-based term, which changes the keys, so when frequencies are the same, the sort order is determined by the index, thus preserving the original order. So in the example, the two 2's are at positions 0 and 2. So their modified keys would be -2.0 and (-1 + 2/4) = -0.5. So when sorted, 0 comes before 2 because -2.0 < -0.5. So the sorted order would be 0,2,1,3, leading to [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So why in my earlier calculation did I think the order was 0,1,2,3? Because I thought the modified keys for position 1 is -0.75, which is less than -0.5, so position 1 would come before 2. But that's not correct because position 2's key is -0.5, which is higher than -0.75. So in the sorted order, position 1 comes before position 2.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nFor the example, the tokens are [2,4,2,1], indices 0,1,2,3.\n\nhist is [2,1,1,1], so neg_hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1].\n\nIn make_sort(), keys are modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Here, min_key is 1, max_seq_len is 4 (from the example).\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: -2 + (1*0)/4 = -2.0\ni=1: -1 + (1*1)/4 = -0.75\ni=2: -1 + (1*2)/4 = -0.5\ni=3: -1 + (1*3)/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the modified keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25].\n\nWhen sorted in ascending order, the order of indices is 0,1,2,3 because -2.0 < -0.75 < -0.5 < -0.25.\n\nSo the sorted tokens would be [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So that's a problem. So the current implementation isn't handling this case correctly.\n\nSo what's wrong here? The issue is that when multiple tokens have the same frequency, their modified keys are still unique, but the sorting order is based on these modified keys, which may not group the same-frequency tokens together in the original order.\n\nWait, but in the example, the two 2's have the same frequency, so their neg_hist is the same (-2 and -1? Wait no, wait the hist for each token is the count. So for token 2, which appears at positions 0 and 2, the hist for each position is 2,1,1,1. So the neg_hist is -2 for position 0, and -1 for positions 1,2,3. So when we modify the keys in make_sort(), position 0's key becomes -2.0, position 1 becomes -0.75, position 2 becomes -0.5, position 3 becomes -0.25.\n\nSo when sorted, the order is 0,1,2,3, so the output is [2,4,2,1], but the expected output is [2,2,4,1]. So the current approach isn't working as intended.\n\nSo the problem is that the current method in make_sort_freq isn't correctly grouping tokens with the same frequency. Instead, it's sorting all tokens based on their modified keys, which may not preserve the original order for same-frequency tokens.\n\nSo how can we fix this? We need to sort the tokens primarily by their frequency (higher first) and secondarily by their original positions.\n\nIn the current approach, the keys are the negative frequencies, which works for the primary sort. But the secondary sort should be based on the original indices in ascending order to preserve the order.\n\nBut in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len, which for same-frequency tokens, adds a value based on their index. However, this causes the sort to order same-frequency tokens by their index, but in the example, the two 2's are at indices 0 and 2. So when sorted, index 0 comes before 2, which is correct. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the two 2's are placed first, followed by 4 and 1. So why isn't the current approach producing that?\n\nWait, in the current approach, the modified keys for same-frequency tokens are unique, so when sorted, they are ordered by their modified keys. For the two 2's, their modified keys are -2.0 (index 0) and -0.5 (index 2). So in the sorted order, index 0 comes before index 2 because -2.0 < -0.5. So the output would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So why in my earlier calculation did I think the output was [2,4,2,1]?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me re-examine:\n\nIn the example, the input is [2,4,2,1]. The hist is [2,1,1,1]. So the neg_hist is [-2,-1,-1,-1]. Then, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding 1 * i /4.\n\nSo for each token:\n\n- Token at position 0: key = -2 + 0/4 = -2.0\n- Token at position 1: key = -1 + 1/4 = -0.75\n- Token at position 2: key = -1 + 2/4 = -0.5\n- Token at position 3: key = -1 + 3/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the modified keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25].\n\nWhen sorted in ascending order, the order of indices is 0,1,2,3. So the sorted tokens would be [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So according to the current code, the output would be [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So the code isn't producing the expected output. Therefore, there's a bug in make_sort_freq.\n\nSo what's the issue? The problem is that the current approach in make_sort() is adding the index-based term to the keys, which for same-frequency tokens, causes them to be sorted by their index. However, in the example, the two 2's are at indices 0 and 2. So when sorted, index 0 comes before index 2, so the tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct. But according to the modified keys, the order is 0,1,2,3, which would give [2,4,2,1]. So why is that?\n\nWait, no. The modified keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25]. So when sorted, the order is from smallest to largest key. So the smallest is -2.0 (index 0), next is -0.75 (index1), then -0.5 (index2), then -0.25 (index3). So the sorted order is indices 0,1,2,3. So the output is [2,4,2,1], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. So the current code isn't producing the expected output.\n\nSo the problem is that the current approach in make_sort_freq isn't correctly ordering same-frequency tokens. The example expects that same-frequency tokens are ordered as per their original positions, but the current code is adding the index-based term, which changes the sort order.\n\nSo how can we fix this? We need to sort primarily by frequency (descending) and secondarily by the original index (ascending). So the key for sorting should be a tuple (-frequency, index). But in RASP, we can't directly create tuples, so we need to encode this into a single key.\n\nOne approach is to create a key that combines the negative frequency and the index in a way that when sorted, the primary sort is by frequency, and the secondary is by index. For example, the key could be (-frequency) + (index * epsilon), where epsilon is a small value that doesn't affect the primary sort but ensures that for same frequencies, the index determines the order.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't use epsilon directly because it's a floating-point operation, but perhaps we can encode it using the existing operations.\n\nAlternatively, in make_sort_freq, instead of using make_sort, which adds the index-based term, perhaps we should create a composite key that first sorts by the negative frequency and then by the index.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, after computing hist, we can create a key that is (-hist) + (index * min_key / max_seq_len). This way, tokens with higher frequency come first, and for same frequencies, tokens with lower indices come first.\n\nWait, but in the current make_sort function, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. So perhaps in make_sort_freq, we should adjust how the keys are constructed before passing to make_sort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the keys are being passed as hist, but perhaps we need to include the index in the key.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in make_sort_freq, the keys are only based on the frequency, and when frequencies are the same, the sort order is determined by the index, but the current approach in make_sort() is adding the index-based term, which may not correctly order the tokens as per the original positions.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to modify make_sort_freq to include the index in the key before passing to make_sort. For example, the key could be (-hist) + (index * min_key / max_seq_len), ensuring that same-frequency tokens are ordered by their index.\n\nBut how can we do that in RASP? Let's think.\n\nIn make_sort_freq, after computing hist, we can create a new key that combines the negative hist and the index. So:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + i * min_key / max_seq_len, hist, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, no, because hist is an SOp, and rasp.indices is another SOp. So using SequenceMap, we can add the index-based term to the hist.\n\nWait, but hist is the histogram, which is an SOp. So in make_sort_freq, after computing hist, we can create a new key by adding the index-based term to the negative hist.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nhist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nneg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\nindex_based = rasp.Map(lambda i: i * min_key / max_seq_len, rasp.indices).named(\"index_based\")\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x + y, neg_hist, index_based).named(\"keys\")\n\nThen, pass keys to make_sort.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq does:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist()\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key)\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that the index-based term isn't being added correctly. So to fix this, in make_sort_freq, after computing hist, we should create a key that is (-hist) + (index * min_key / max_seq_len), and pass this as the keys to make_sort.\n\nSo, modifying make_sort_freq:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    index_based = rasp.Map(lambda i: i * 1.0 / max_seq_len, rasp.indices).named(\"index_based\")\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x + y, neg_hist, index_based).named(\"keys\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but min_key is 1, so the index_based term is i * 1 / max_seq_len. This way, for same-frequency tokens, the index adds a small value that ensures they are sorted by their original index.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the two 2's are at indices 0 and 2. So their keys would be:\n\n- For index 0: -2 + 0 * 1/4 = -2.0\n- For index 2: -2 + 2 * 1/4 = -1.5\n\nWait, no, because hist for index 0 is 2 (since token 2 appears twice), so neg_hist is -2. For index 2, the token is 2, so hist is 2, neg_hist is -2. So both have the same neg_hist. Then, adding index_based (i * 1/4):\n\nindex 0: -2 + 0 = -2.0\nindex 1: -1 + 1/4 = -0.75\nindex 2: -2 + 2/4 = -1.5\nindex 3: -1 + 3/4 = -0.25\n\nSo the keys are [-2.0, -0.75, -1.5, -0.25].\n\nWhen sorted in ascending order, the order is:\n\n-2.0 (index0), -1.5 (index2), -0.75 (index1), -0.25 (index3).\n\nSo the sorted tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example.\n\nSo the fix is to modify make_sort_freq to include the index-based term in the keys before passing to make_sort.\n\nSo, in the current code, make_sort_freq is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut this is incorrect because it doesn't include the index-based term. So we need to compute the keys as (-hist) + (index * min_key / max_seq_len).\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort_freq would compute the keys correctly.\n\nAnother issue is in make_sort(), where the return statement has a multiplication by -1, which is incorrect. So that needs to be removed.\n\nSo, to summarize the fixes:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the return statement should be 'return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)' without the multiplication.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the keys should be computed as (-hist) + (index * min_key / max_seq_len) before passing to make_sort.\n\nNow, let's apply these fixes to the code.\n\nFirst, correcting make_sort():\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nWait, no, the original code had 'return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1', which is wrong. So we just remove the * -1.\n\nSecond, in make_sort_freq(), compute the correct keys:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    neg_hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, hist).named(\"neg_hist\")\n    index_based = rasp.Map(lambda i: i * 1.0 / max_seq_len, rasp.indices).named(\"index_based\")\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x + y, neg_hist, index_based).named(\"keys\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, keys, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nSo we need to replace that with the code that computes the keys correctly.\n\nPutting it all together, the corrected code would have:\n\n- make_sort() returns make_sort_unique without multiplying.\n- make_sort_freq() computes the keys with both neg_hist and index_based.\n\nSo, the final code would be:\n\n[The corrected code is provided in the answer below.]\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4632, "completion_tokens": 5867, "total_tokens": 10499}}, {"id": "gen-1738411213-eO7iB4c4EZKuofrP2d6Z", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411213, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, the primary issue was in the `make_sort` function where the result was incorrectly multiplied by -1, reversing the sorted order.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each key's position in the sorted order is its index. So sel_new would select the correct positions. Then Aggregate should pick the corresponding vals. That seems correct. But wait, in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is the sorted keys. So if vals are the same as keys, it works. But what if vals are different? I think the function is correct as it's supposed to sort vals based on keys.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses SequenceMap to add min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Then calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after modification, they become unique. Then sorting them would order correctly. But the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Wait, why multiply by -1? Oh, because the sort is based on the < relation, so multiplying by -1 would reverse the order. But wait, in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is ascending order. So if the original sort is in ascending order, multiplying by -1 would make it descending. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the function is incorrectly applying the multiplication. Let me check the example: when make_sort is called with [2,4,3,1], the keys after modification would be 2 + 1*0/5=2, 4+1*1/5=4.2, 3+1*2/5=3.4, 1+1*3/5=1.6. So the modified keys are [2,4.2,3.4,1.6]. Sorting these would order as 1.6,2,3.4,4.2, which corresponds to indices 3,0,2,1. So the sorted vals would be [1,2,3,4], which is correct. But the function returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Wait, that would reverse the order. So in the example, it would return [4,3,2,1], which is wrong. So that's a bug. The multiplication by -1 is incorrect. It should not be there. So the line should just return make_sort_unique(vals, keys), without the * -1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The make_sort_unique function sorts in ascending order because it's based on the 'smaller' selector. So when we pass the modified keys, which are unique, the sort should already be correct. So why is there a * -1? That's probably a mistake. So I need to remove that multiplication.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It computes the histogram, then negates it. Then uses make_sort with tokens as vals and hist as keys, along with max_seq_len and min_key. The idea is that tokens with higher frequency come first. But since hist is negated, the sort will be in ascending order of hist, which would place higher frequencies first. Wait, no. Because when you negate the hist, higher frequencies become more negative. So when sorted in ascending order, more negative comes first, which would be higher frequencies. So that's correct. For example, hist is [2,1,2,1], negated to [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The keys would be modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. Let's say max_seq_len is 5 and min_key is 1. So the modified keys would be -2 + 0/5 = -2, -1 +1/5=-0.8, -2 +2/5=-1.6, -1 +3/5=-0.4. Sorting these would order as -2, -1.6, -0.8, -0.4. So the order of indices would be 0,2,1,3. So the tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which is correct. So the function seems correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the call is make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...). But hist is the negated histogram. So the keys are the negated counts. So when sorted, lower keys (more negative) come first, which correspond to higher counts. So the tokens are sorted by frequency in descending order. That's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the return statement incorrectly multiplies by -1. That's causing the sorted order to be reversed. So I need to remove that multiplication.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i / max_seq_len. But what if the keys are not numeric? The function's note says it only works for numerical keys, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. In make_sort(), remove the * -1 in the return statement.\n2. Ensure that all functions are correctly using the RASP operations without any invalid steps.\n\nLet me go through each function again.\n\nmake_hist() looks correct.\n\nmake_sort_unique() seems correct.\n\nmake_sort() had the issue with * -1. Fixing that.\n\nmake_sort_freq() seems correct.\n\nSo the only change needed is in make_sort(), removing the multiplication by -1.\n\nWait, but looking at the original code:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nThat's incorrect because it's multiplying the SOp by -1, which would apply a Map lambda x: -x. But the intention was to sort in ascending order, so no need to reverse. So the correct code should be:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nSo that's the fix.\n\nNow, I'll write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 2214, "total_tokens": 6837}}, {"id": "gen-1738411301-I0nY4Eb2IWf0SASuDPij", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411301, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and fixed them by correctly applying RASP operations without invalid multiplications.\n\nThe corrected code is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.

So target_pos should give the position where each element should be placed in a sorted list. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals using this selector. Wait, but when you aggregate, if each row of the selector has exactly one True, it picks that value. So this should correctly sort the vals based on keys. But I need to make sure that the keys are unique, as the function says. So this seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by modifying the keys to make them unique. It uses max_seq_len and min_key. The current code is adding min_key * i / max_seq_len to each key. Wait, i is the index, right? So for each position i, it's adding a small value based on the index. This ensures that keys are unique because each position's key is slightly different. Then it calls make_sort_unique with these modified keys. But wait, the original code returns make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1. Oh, that's a problem. Because make_sort_unique returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation in RASP. SOps can't be multiplied like that. So that's an error. Instead, the sorting should be in ascending order without negating. Or perhaps the keys were being sorted in descending order, but that's not the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, in make_sort(), the function is supposed to sort vals based on keys in ascending order. The original approach in the RASP paper might have used a different method, but here, the code is trying to make the keys unique by adding a small value based on the index. Then it calls make_sort_unique, which sorts based on the modified keys. But then multiplying by -1 is incorrect because it's not a valid operation. So that line is wrong. Instead, after making the keys unique, the sorting should proceed correctly without negation. So the return statement should just be make_sort_unique(vals, keys), not multiplied by -1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The make_sort_unique function sorts in ascending order because it's based on the 'smaller' selector which uses LT. So when we pass the modified keys, which are unique, it should sort correctly. So the mistake is the multiplication by -1, which isn't a valid operation. So that line needs to be fixed.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram, then negates it to sort in ascending order of frequency. Wait, no. The code does hist = -1 * make_hist(), but again, multiplying an SOp by a scalar isn't allowed. So that's another error. Instead, the histogram counts should be used as keys, and then sorted in ascending order. But to sort by frequency, higher frequency should come first, so perhaps we need to sort in descending order. Alternatively, the code is trying to negate the histogram so that when sorted in ascending order, it's effectively descending. But since we can't multiply SOps by scalars, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, the issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the return statement incorrectly multiplies by -1, which is invalid.\n2. In make_sort_freq(), the histogram is negated using multiplication, which is also invalid.\n\nLet me think about how to fix these.\n\nFor make_sort(), the problem is that after making the keys unique, the sort is in ascending order. But perhaps the original code intended to sort in descending order, hence the multiplication. But that's incorrect. So instead, we should adjust the way we create the 'smaller' selector. Alternatively, perhaps the make_sort_unique function is correct, and the multiplication was a mistake. So the fix is to remove the * -1.\n\nFor make_sort_freq(), instead of negating the histogram, we should sort in descending order. But how? Because make_sort() is designed to sort in ascending order. So perhaps we need to adjust the keys so that higher frequencies come first. One way is to multiply the histogram by -1, but since that's not possible, we can instead create a new key that is the negative of the histogram. But again, we can't multiply SOps by scalars. So another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of negating, we can adjust the comparison. For make_sort_freq, we want to sort tokens based on their frequency in descending order. So the keys for sorting should be such that higher frequencies come first. So in make_sort_freq, instead of using hist as the key, we can create a new key that is the negative of hist, but without using multiplication. Alternatively, we can create a new SOp that represents the negative, but since we can't do that directly, perhaps we can use a lambda function in a Map to invert the values.\n\nWait, but in RASP, you can't just negate a sequence. So another approach is to sort in descending order by using a different comparison. But the make_sort() function is designed to sort in ascending order. So perhaps we can adjust the keys so that when sorted in ascending order, the effect is as if we sorted by descending frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in make_sort_freq, instead of negating the histogram, we can create a new key that is a function of the histogram that allows us to sort in the desired order.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the code is trying to sort the tokens based on their frequency, with higher frequencies first. So the keys should be such that when sorted in ascending order, the tokens are ordered by descending frequency. To achieve this, the keys can be set to the negative of the histogram. But since we can't multiply by -1, we can use a Map to apply a lambda that subtracts the histogram from zero.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, instead of hist = -1 * make_hist(), which is invalid, we can create a new SOp that is the negative of the histogram. But how? Since we can't multiply, we can use a Map with a lambda function.\n\nSo, hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()). But wait, can we do that? Because make_hist() returns an SOp, and Map applies a function element-wise. So yes, that's possible.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the line is hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\"), which is incorrect. So replacing it with a Map that negates each element would fix it.\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort_freq would be:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\nreturn make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut wait, does this work? Because make_sort() will sort based on the keys in ascending order. So if the keys are negative frequencies, sorting in ascending order would place higher frequencies (which are more negative) first. Wait, no. For example, if frequencies are [2,1,2,1], the negative would be [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Sorting in ascending order would arrange them as -2, -2, -1, -1, which corresponds to the original order. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The tokens are [2,4,2,1], and the histogram is [2,1,2,1]. So the keys for sorting would be the histogram, which is [2,1,2,1]. To sort in descending order of frequency, we want the tokens with higher counts to come first. So the keys should be such that when sorted in ascending order, the higher counts come first. So perhaps the keys should be the negative of the histogram. Because when you sort negative numbers in ascending order, the larger magnitudes come first. For example, -2 is less than -1, so in a sorted list, -2 comes before -1. So when you sort the keys in ascending order, the tokens with higher original counts (which are now negative) will come first.\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose the histogram is [3,2,3,1]. The negative would be [-3,-2,-3,-1]. Sorting these in ascending order would give [-3, -3, -2, -1]. So the corresponding tokens would be ordered as the first token, third token, second token, fourth token. But the desired order for descending frequency is [3,3,2,1], so the tokens should be ordered as first, third, second, fourth. So yes, using the negative histogram as keys and sorting in ascending order would achieve the desired result.\n\nSo, in make_sort_freq, the correct approach is to negate the histogram using a Map, then pass it to make_sort, which sorts in ascending order, thus effectively sorting the tokens by descending frequency.\n\nSo, the steps to fix are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), remove the multiplication by -1. So the return statement is just make_sort_unique(vals, keys).\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), replace the line where hist is assigned with a Map that negates the histogram. So hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\").\n\nLet me check the code again.\n\nIn make_sort(), the original code is:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\nWhich is invalid. So change it to:\n\nreturn make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nIn make_sort_freq(), the original code is:\n\nhist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n\nWhich is invalid. So change it to:\n\nhist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n\nWait, but make_hist() returns an SOp, so we can apply Map to it.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the corrected functions would be:\n\nFor make_sort():\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\nAnd for make_sort_freq():\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\nWait, but in make_sort_freq, the min_key is 1. Is that correct? Because the keys are now negative, so adding min_key * i / max_seq_len might not be necessary. Or perhaps it's still needed to ensure uniqueness. Hmm, but the keys are negative, and adding a small positive value based on index would make them unique. So it's still necessary to ensure that all keys are unique for the sorting to work correctly.\n\nSo the changes are:\n\n- Remove the multiplication by -1 in make_sort().\n- Replace the negation in make_sort_freq() with a Map that applies a lambda to negate each element.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Now, I'll write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 3264, "total_tokens": 7887}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys) * -1\n\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.2}
