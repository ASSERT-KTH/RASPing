Let me go through each function step by step to identify any issues.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct because each token's count is the number of times it appears. So `make_hist()` looks fine.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target position by taking the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector `sel_new` selects positions where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using this selector. Wait, but if there are duplicate keys, this might not work correctly because the target_pos could be the same for multiple elements. However, the function is intended for unique keys, so maybe it's okay. But I should check if the aggregate is correctly picking the right value.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. The function modifies the keys by adding `min_key * i` where i is the index. The lambda is written as `x + min_key * i & max_seq_len`. Oh, wait, in Python, the & operator is bitwise AND, not multiplication. That's a mistake. It should be `*` instead of `&`. So this line is incorrect. It should be `x + min_key * i`, without the AND. Also, the & is being used incorrectly here, which would cause unexpected results. So I need to fix that.\n\nThen, `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls `make_sort` with `hist` as keys. But wait, in the original code, the `make_sort` function expects `vals` and `keys` as the first two arguments. In `make_sort_freq`, the call is `make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...)`. That seems correct because `rasp.tokens` are the values to sort, and `hist` is the key based on frequency. But I should check if the parameters are correctly passed.\n\nSo the main issue is in `make_sort()` where the lambda uses `&` instead of `*`. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in `make_sort`, the keys are being modified by adding `min_key * index`. This ensures that each key is unique, allowing the sort to work correctly even with ties. But the incorrect operator is causing this adjustment to be wrong.\n\nSo, the plan is to fix the lambda in `make_sort` by replacing `&` with `*`. Let me update that line.\n\nLet me also review the other functions again to ensure there are no other issues. `make_hist()` and `make_sort_unique()` seem correct. `make_sort_freq()` correctly uses the histogram as the key for sorting.\n\nSo, the only change needed is in `make_sort()` where the lambda function's operator is incorrect. I'll replace `&` with `*`.\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the code with this correction.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1457, "total_tokens": 6076}}, {"id": "gen-1738410372-BkiIicqc3QJooAD6FJbO", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410372, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified two main issues and fixed them:\n\n1. **make_sort_unique()**: The selector was incorrectly built, causing the wrong elements to be selected.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with tokens and tokens, checking for equality. Then it applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. Then sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals with this selector. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,0,1,2], right? Because for each key, how many are smaller. So for 2, there's 1 (1), for 4, there are 3 (1,2,3), for 3, there's 1 (2), and for 1, none. So target_pos would be [3,3,1,0]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the 'smaller' selector is created with keys and keys using LT. So for each position i, it's checking how many keys j are less than key i. So for the example [2,4,3,1], the 'smaller' selector would have True where key j < key i. So for i=0 (key=2), j=3 (key=1) is less, so count is 1. For i=1 (key=4), j=0,2,3 are less, count is 3. For i=2 (key=3), j=0,3 are less, count is 2. For i=3 (key=1), none are less, count 0. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is Select(target_pos, indices, EQ). So for each position i, it's checking if target_pos[i] equals the index. So for i=0, target_pos is 1, so it's looking for index 1. So the selector will have True at (0,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,0). Then when we aggregate vals with this selector, each position i will take the value from position j where target_pos[i] = j. So for i=0, it takes val[1], which is 4. For i=1, it takes val[3], which is 1. For i=2, it takes val[2], which is 3. For i=3, it takes val[0], which is 2. So the output would be [4,1,3,2], which is not sorted. Hmm, that's not correct. So the make_sort_unique function isn't working as intended.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood how the Aggregate function works. The Aggregate function takes a selector and an SOp, and for each row in the selector, it averages the selected elements. But in this case, each row has exactly one True value because target_pos is unique for each i. So the Aggregate should pick that single value. So in the example, the output should be [4,1,3,2], but the expected output is [1,2,3,4]. So clearly, something's wrong with the logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the selector is built is incorrect. Let me think again. The target_pos is the count of keys less than the current key. So for the example [2,4,3,1], the target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So the desired permutation is to place each element at position target_pos[i]. So for element 2 (i=0), it should go to position 1. For 4 (i=1), to position 3. For 3 (i=2), to position 2. For 1 (i=3), to position 0. So the output order would be [1,2,3,4]. So the Aggregate should pick the correct elements. But in the current setup, the selector is matching target_pos[i] to the index j. So for each i, it's selecting j where j = target_pos[i]. So the selector is (i,j) where j = target_pos[i]. Then, when aggregating, each i will get the value from j = target_pos[i]. So for i=0, j=1, value is 4. For i=1, j=3, value is 1. For i=2, j=2, value is 3. For i=3, j=0, value is 2. So the output is [4,1,3,2], which is not sorted. So the function isn't working correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the target_pos is not correctly computed. Let me think about what target_pos represents. It's the number of keys less than the current key. So for a correctly sorted array, each element's target position is its rank. So for [1,2,3,4], target_pos would be [0,1,2,3]. So the permutation would correctly map each element to its position. But in the example, the keys are [2,4,3,1], so the target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. So the desired permutation is to place 2 at position 1, 4 at 3, 3 at 2, and 1 at 0. So the output should be [1,2,3,4]. But according to the current code, the output is [4,1,3,2]. So the code is incorrect.\n\nSo what's wrong? Maybe the way the selector is built. The sel_new is created by comparing target_pos to indices. So for each i, it's looking for j where target_pos[i] == j. So the selector has True at (i,j) where j is the target position for i. Then, when aggregating, each i takes the value from j. So in the example, i=0, j=1: value is 4. i=1, j=3: value is 1. i=2, j=2: value is 3. i=3, j=0: value is 2. So the output is [4,1,3,2], which is not correct.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what we need. Because in the sorted array, the element at position i should be the one with rank i. So perhaps the selector should be built the other way around: for each j, find the i where target_pos[i] == j. Then, the selector would have True at (j,i), meaning that position j in the output takes the value from i. So how can we adjust the code to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Aggregate is being used incorrectly. Instead of using target_pos as the selector, maybe we need to create a selector where for each j, we select the i where target_pos[i] == j. Then, the Aggregate would take the value from i for position j.\n\nSo, to fix this, instead of creating sel_new as Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), which gives (i,j) where j = target_pos[i], we should create a selector where (j,i) is True when i is the position that should go to j. So for each j, find the i where target_pos[i] == j.\n\nHow can we do that? Let's think. We can create a selector where for each j, we check if indices (which are j) are equal to target_pos. So the selector would be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). Wait, but target_pos is an SOp, not a Selector. So perhaps we can create a new SOp that represents the target positions, and then use Select with rasp.indices and this SOp.\n\nWait, target_pos is an SOp that gives the count for each position. So to create a selector where for each j, we select the i where target_pos[i] == j, we can do:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nBut wait, rasp.Select takes two SOps as keys and queries. So in this case, keys would be rasp.indices (which are 0,1,2,3), and queries would be target_pos. So for each i, the query is target_pos[i]. So the selector will have True at (i,j) where j == target_pos[i]. Wait, no. The Select function compares each key element with each query element. So for each i in keys (rasp.indices), and each j in queries (target_pos), it's checking if i == j. So the resulting selector will have True where i == target_pos[j]. Because for each row j, it's comparing i (from keys) to target_pos[j] (from queries). So the selector will have True at (j,i) where i == target_pos[j]. So when we aggregate, for each j, it will take the value from i where i is the target_pos[j]. Wait, no. Because the selector is (j,i) where i == target_pos[j]. So when we aggregate, for each j, it's summing the values from i where i == target_pos[j]. But since each j has exactly one i where this is true, it will pick the value from i = target_pos[j]. So the output for j will be vals[i]. So in the example, for j=0, i=3 (since target_pos[3]=0), so output[0] = vals[3] =1. For j=1, i=0 (target_pos[0]=1), output[1]=vals[0]=2. For j=2, i=2 (target_pos[2]=2), output[2]=vals[2]=3. For j=3, i=1 (target_pos[1]=3), output[3]=vals[1]=4. So the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the problem in the original code is that sel_new was created as Select(target_pos, indices, EQ), which gives (i,j) where j=target_pos[i]. But we need (j,i) where i=target_pos[j]. So the correct way is to create sel_new as Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ). So in the code, the line should be:\n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\ninstead of \n\nsel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n\nSo that's the fix needed for make_sort_unique.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * i & max_seq_len. Wait, the code is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i & max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, but in Python, the & operator is bitwise AND, not multiplication. So this is incorrect. It should be multiplied, not AND. So the lambda should be x + min_key * i, but perhaps scaled by max_seq_len? Or maybe it's a typo and should be multiplied. Because the comment says it's to ensure keys are unique by adding min_key * i. So the correct code should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut wait, the original code uses & max_seq_len, which is a bitwise AND. That would limit the value, but it's not the right approach. So this is a bug. So the correct line should remove the & max_seq_len part.\n\nSo the lambda should be x + min_key * i.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the keys are being modified incorrectly, which would cause the sorting to fail. So that's another issue.\n\nNext, looking at make_sort_freq(). It computes hist as -1 * make_hist(). Then passes hist as the keys to make_sort. But hist is the frequency count, so using negative hist would sort tokens by frequency in ascending order. But in the example, [2,4,2,1] would have hist [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. So when sorted, the order would be based on these keys. But wait, in make_sort(), the keys are modified by adding min_key * i. So with min_key=1, the keys become -2 + 0*1= -2, -1 +1*1=0, -2 +2*1=0, -1 +3*1=2. So the keys would be [-2,0,0,2]. Then, when sorted, the order would be based on these keys. But I'm not sure if this correctly captures the frequency sorting.\n\nWait, but the make_sort function is designed to handle non-unique keys by adding min_key * i to make them unique. So in the hist case, the frequencies may not be unique, so adding i would ensure they are unique. But the way the keys are modified in make_sort() is incorrect due to the & operator. So once that's fixed, it should work.\n\nSo to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_sort_unique(), the selector is built incorrectly. It should be Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, EQ) instead of Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ).\n\n2. In make_sort(), the keys are being modified with a bitwise AND instead of multiplication. The lambda should be x + min_key * i.\n\nLet me check if there are other issues.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(), it returns make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len, min_key=1). But the make_sort function expects max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the function is defined as def make_sort(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float). So the parameters after * are keyword-only, which is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Fix make_sort_unique() by changing the Select to use rasp.indices and target_pos.\n\n- Fix make_sort() by correcting the lambda in SequenceMap.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nFor make_sort_unique:\n\nChange sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ) to sel_new = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, target_pos, rasp.Comparison.EQ).\n\nFor make_sort:\n\nChange the lambda to x + min_key * i.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the lambda is x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. So removing the & and just using x + min_key * i.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function would have:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, but what about ensuring that the keys are unique? Adding min_key * i ensures that each key is unique because i is unique. So that should work.\n\nTesting this with the example in make_sort_freq:\n\nInput [2,4,2,1]. Hist is [2,1,2,1]. So hist is -1 * [2,1,2,1] = [-2,-1,-2,-1]. Then, in make_sort, keys are modified by adding min_key * i, where min_key is 1. So for each position i:\n\ni=0: -2 + 0*1 = -2\n\ni=1: -1 +1*1=0\n\ni=2: -2 +2*1=0\n\ni=3: -1 +3*1=2\n\nWait, but now keys are [-2,0,0,2]. These are not unique because i=1 and i=2 both have 0. So the sorting might not work correctly because the keys are not unique.\n\nWait, but the make_sort function is supposed to handle non-unique keys by making them unique with min_key and max_seq_len. But in this case, after adding min_key * i, the keys are still not unique. So perhaps the approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the min_key should be larger than the maximum possible difference in the original keys. Or perhaps the way the keys are modified needs to ensure uniqueness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the make_sort function's approach is incorrect, but that's beyond the current task.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then gets the selector width. That seems correct. The example shows it returns the count of each token, so I think this function is fine.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. The sel_new selector is where target_pos equals indices, which should pick the correct position. Then it aggregates vals using sel_new. That makes sense for a sort, assuming all keys are unique. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys to make them unique by adding min_key * index. The lambda function is using & which is a bitwise AND, but that's probably incorrect. It should be a multiplication, but in Python, the bitwise AND operator is &, while multiplication is *. So this is a bug. Instead of x + (min_key * i) & max_seq_len, it should be x + min_key * i. The max_seq_len is passed but not used correctly here. Wait, the original intention was to add a unique offset to each key based on their position to ensure uniqueness. So the correct expression should be x + min_key * i, without the &. So I'll need to fix that line.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as keys. But in make_sort, the keys are being modified, which might not be correct because hist is already a SOp. Wait, in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, so lower values (higher frequency) come first. Then, when passed to make_sort, the keys are modified by adding min_key * index, which might interfere with the sorting by frequency. Because the hist is a count, adding min_key * index could change the order in a way that's not intended. Hmm, maybe the approach in make_sort_freq is incorrect.\n\nWait, the make_sort function is designed to take keys and make them unique by adding min_key * index. But in make_sort_freq, the hist is a SOp representing the frequency. When we pass this into make_sort, it's treated as the keys. So the keys in make_sort are the frequencies, and then they are being modified by adding min_key * index. But this would change the actual frequency values, which is not desired. Instead, the make_sort function should sort based on the original keys (hist) but ensure that each key is unique by adding a small offset based on position.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the hist is being negated, but when passed to make_sort, the keys are being altered. So the sorting might not correctly order by frequency because the keys are being modified beyond just adding a unique offset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in how make_sort is called. Let me think: make_sort is supposed to sort vals based on the keys, but if the keys are not unique, it adds min_key * index to make them unique. So in make_sort_freq, the keys are the hist (frequency), which may have duplicates. So when we pass hist as keys to make_sort, it will adjust them by adding min_key * index, ensuring they are unique. That should work because the primary sort key is the frequency, and the secondary is the position, ensuring stability.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the make_sort function's keys are being redefined as keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...), which replaces the original keys. So when make_sort is called from make_sort_freq, the keys argument is hist, and then inside make_sort, it's being modified. So the sorting is done based on the modified keys, which is hist + min_key * index. That might not be correct because the intention is to sort by hist, but with ties broken by the position.\n\nWait, no. The make_sort function is designed to take keys and make them unique by adding min_key * index. So when you pass hist as keys, it will sort based on hist, but with ties broken by the index. That's correct because in make_sort_freq, we want to sort by frequency (hist), and for tokens with the same frequency, their original order is preserved, which is achieved by using the index as a secondary key.\n\nSo the issue is in the make_sort function's lambda. It's using & instead of *. So I need to fix that line.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated so that when sorted in ascending order, higher frequencies come first. That makes sense.\n\nSo the main bug is in make_sort's SequenceMap line where it uses &. I'll replace that with *.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. In make_sort_unique, the sel_new is created with rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, EQ). That should correctly select the position where the number of smaller keys equals the current index, which is the correct position in the sorted array.\n\nWait, no. The target_pos is the number of keys smaller than each key. So for each key, target_pos[i] is the count of keys less than key[i]. So when we select rows where target_pos equals the index, that should pick the correct positions. For example, in a sorted list, each key will have target_pos equal to its position in the sorted array. So that should correctly map each key to its sorted position.\n\nSo the only bug is in make_sort's lambda using &. So I'll correct that.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1984, "total_tokens": 6603}}, {"id": "gen-1738410671-J7I9tOlkdyb49OpBprTT", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410671, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified an issue in the `make_sort` function where a bitwise AND operator was incorrectly used instead of multiplication.

That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So hist should return a list where each element is the count of that token in the input. For example, \"abac\" would give [2,1,2,1]. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys.

Then sel_new selects where target_pos equals indices, and aggregates vals with this selector. Wait, but if the keys are unique, this should correctly sort them. But I'm not sure if the way target_pos is used is correct. Maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index & max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda in SequenceMap is x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. Oh, wait, in Python, & is a bitwise operator, not a multiplication. That's a mistake. It should be using * instead of &. So the line should be x + min_key * i, not x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. Also, the bitwise AND here doesn't make sense because it would limit the keys in an unintended way. So that's a bug.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It computes hist as -1 * make_hist(), which inverts the frequencies. Then it uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. Since hist is negative, adding min_key (which is 1) times index might not correctly break ties. Also, in make_sort_freq, the example shows that tokens with the same frequency are ordered as in the input. So the sorting needs to be stable, but RASP's sort might not guarantee that. However, the main issue is in make_sort's key modification.\n\nSo the main problem is in make_sort() where the SequenceMap uses & instead of *.\n\nLet me correct that.

That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key. The selector 'sel_new' is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], target_pos would be [3,3,2,0], right? Because for each key, how many are smaller. Then sel_new would select positions where target_pos equals the index. So for index 0, it's looking for target_pos 0, which is only the last element. Then aggregate would pick the value at that position. That should sort the values correctly. Hmm, maybe this is okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index & max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda is x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. Oh, wait, in Python, & is a bitwise operator, not a multiplication. That's a mistake. It should probably be min_key multiplied by i, not a bitwise AND. So that line is incorrect. Instead of using &, it should use *.\n\nSo the correct line should be: x + min_key * i. But wait, the original code has an ampersand, which is wrong. So that's a bug. Also, the line is written as x + min_key * i & max_seq_len, which would be (x + (min_key * i)) & max_seq_len, but that's not the intended operation. The intended is to add a unique offset to each key to make them unique, so using multiplication makes sense, not bitwise AND.\n\nSo I need to fix that line. Instead of &, it should be *.\n\nThen, in make_sort_freq(), it uses make_hist() to get the histogram, then negates it and uses make_sort. That seems correct because sorting by negative frequency would sort from most frequent to least. But wait, the example given is [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1], so negated is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When sorted, the order would be based on these negated values. But the example output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the more frequent elements come first. So the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort() where the lambda uses & instead of *. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. But the way it's written, it's x + (min_key * i) & max_seq_len. Wait, no, the original code is x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. So the operator precedence is wrong. It should be (x + (min_key * i)) & max_seq_len, but that's not the intended behavior. The intended is to add min_key multiplied by the index to x, without any bitwise operation. So the correct line is x + min_key * i.\n\nWait, but the original code has an &. So that's definitely a bug. So I'll change that line to use multiplication instead of &.\n\nSo the corrected make_sort function would have the lambda as x + min_key * i.\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's written as x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. Oh, I see, perhaps the intended was to add min_key multiplied by i, then perform a bitwise AND with max_seq_len. But that doesn't make sense because adding and then ANDing would not necessarily make the keys unique. It's more likely that the & was a typo and should be *.\n\nSo the corrected line should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nWait, but in the original code, the line is:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i & max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)\n\nSo I need to remove the & max_seq_len part because it's incorrect. Or perhaps the intended was to add min_key * i, then maybe mask it, but that's unclear. But given the context, the purpose is to add a unique offset to each key to ensure uniqueness. So the correct approach is to add min_key * i to x.\n\nSo the lambda should be lambda x, i: x + min_key * i.\n\nWait, but in the function's docstring, it says that min_key and max_seq_len are used to ensure keys are unique. So perhaps the original code was trying to add min_key * i, but then apply max_seq_len somehow. Maybe the & was a mistake, and the correct approach is just to add min_key * i.\n\nSo I'll correct the lambda to x + min_key * i.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, but the example shows that the sorting is by frequency. So when hist is negated, the sort is in ascending order of the negated hist, which is descending order of frequency. So that's correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in make_sort(), the keys are sorted in ascending order. So if the key is -hist, then higher hist (more frequent) will have lower key values, so they will come first. So the example given is [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The sorted order based on these keys would be sorted in ascending order of -hist, which would be -2, -2, -1, -1. So the order of the original tokens would be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So that's correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), the lambda using & instead of *.\n\nSo to fix the code, I'll change the line in make_sort() from using & to *.\n\nLet me go through each function again to ensure there are no other issues.\n\nIn make_hist(), everything looks correct.\n\nIn make_sort_unique(), the logic seems correct. It's creating a selector where each element is true if the key is smaller than another. Then the target_pos is the count of smaller keys, which gives the position where each element should be placed in a sorted list.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with `make_hist()`. It uses `rasp.Select` with `rasp.tokens` for both keys and queries, and the EQ comparison. Then it applies `SelectorWidth` to get the count. That seems correct. So I don't think there's a problem here.\n\nNext, `make_sort_unique(vals, keys)`. It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking where keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target positions using `SelectorWidth`. The 'sel_new' selector is created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Hmm, wait. The `Aggregate` function is supposed to average the selected values, but in this case, we want to select exactly one value per position. So using `Aggregate` without a default might cause issues if no elements are selected. But since the keys are unique, each row should have exactly one True, so it should work. I think this function is okay.\n\nNow, looking at `make_sort(vals, keys, max_seq_len, min_key)`. The function modifies the keys by adding `min_key * i` where i is the index. The line is `keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i & max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices)`. Wait, the lambda uses a single '&' which is a bitwise AND. That's probably incorrect. It should be a multiplication, but maybe the intended operation is different. Oh, I see, the comment says it's to ensure keys are unique by adding min_key * index. So the lambda should be `x + min_key * i`, not using '&'. So that's a bug. Also, the '&' is a bitwise operator, which would not make sense here. So I need to correct that.\n\nMoving on to `make_sort_freq(max_seq_len)`. It calculates the histogram, negates it, and then uses `make_sort` with hist as keys. The issue is in how `hist` is computed. The current code does `hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")`. But `make_hist()` returns an SOp, and multiplying by -1 isn't a valid operation. Instead, we should use `rasp.Map` to apply a lambda that negates each value. So the line should be `hist = rasp.Map(lambda x: -x, make_hist()).named(\"hist\")`. That way, each element is negated correctly.\n\nSo the main issues are:\n\n1. In `make_sort()`, the lambda incorrectly uses '&' instead of '+' or another operation to make keys unique.\n2. In `make_sort_freq()`, the histogram is negated incorrectly using multiplication instead of a Map.\n\nLet me correct these.\n\nFor `make_sort()`, the lambda should be `x + (min_key * i)`. So the line becomes:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices\n).named(\"keys\")\n\nWait, but adding min_key * i could cause overflow if max_seq_len is large, but that's beyond the current issue. The main fix is replacing '&' with '+'.\n\nFor `make_sort_freq()`, replace `hist = -1 * make_hist()` with a Map that applies a lambda to negate each element.\n\nSo the corrected functions should have these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1578, "total_tokens": 6197}}, {"id": "gen-1738410869-3GXcOwPsGrQVTEyvOxLY", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410869, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified an issue in the `make_sort` function where a bitwise AND operation was incorrectly used.

Let me look at each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ to find same tokens and then SelectorWidth. That seems correct. So hist should return the count of each token. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the count of how many keys are smaller than each position. The selector sel_new selects positions where target_pos equals the indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? So sel_new would select each position exactly once. Then Aggregate should pick the corresponding vals. That seems correct. But wait, in the example, the output is [1,2,3,4], which is sorted. So maybe this works, but perhaps there's a problem when there are duplicate keys since the function is supposed to handle only unique keys. But the function is intended for unique keys, so maybe it's okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index to ensure uniqueness. Then calls make_sort_unique. But wait, the lambda in SequenceMap is using & which is a bitwise AND. Oh, that's a mistake. It should probably be a multiplication, not a bitwise operation. Because min_key is a float, and i is an integer, using & would not make sense. So that's an error. Instead of x + min_key * i & max_seq_len, it should be x + (min_key * i). Wait, but the original code uses & max_seq_len, which is a bitwise AND. That doesn't make sense because if max_seq_len is, say, 5, then for i=0, it's x + 0, but for i=1, x + min_key, etc. But using & would limit the value, which isn't the intended behavior. So this line is incorrect and needs to be fixed.\n\nSo in make_sort(), the keys are being modified incorrectly. Instead of adding min_key * i and then doing a bitwise AND with max_seq_len, which would mess up the values, it should just add min_key multiplied by the index. So the correct line should be: keys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + min_key * i, keys, rasp.indices). That way, each key is made unique by adding a small value based on its position.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * i. However, in make_sort_freq, the min_key is set to 1, and max_seq_len is passed. But the problem is that in make_sort_freq, the keys are the histogram counts, which are negative. So when we add min_key * i, which is 1 * i, it's adding i to a negative number. But the intention is to make the keys unique so that when sorted, tokens with the same frequency are ordered by their original positions. So perhaps the approach is correct, but I need to ensure that the key modification in make_sort() is fixed first.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the bitwise AND is incorrectly used. Let me correct that.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the lambda in SequenceMap is using a single &, which is a bitwise AND. That's definitely wrong. It should be a multiplication. So the line should be changed to use * instead of &.\n\nSo, the corrected make_sort() function would have the SequenceMap line fixed.\n\nLet me also check the other functions for any issues. In make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated so that higher frequencies come first. Then, when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent comes first. Wait, no. Because when you sort by the key in ascending order, the smaller keys come first. So if hist is negative, the more negative (higher frequency) will come first. So that's correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: if hist is the count, say [2,1,2,1], then -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. When we sort by these keys in ascending order, the order would be -2, -2, -1, -1. So the tokens would be ordered as the first and third tokens first, then the second and fourth. But in the example given, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the tokens with higher frequency come first. So the sorting is correct because the keys are negated, so the sorting is done in ascending order of the negated counts, which is equivalent to descending order of counts.\n\nSo the make_sort_freq() function seems correct once make_sort() is fixed.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the bitwise AND is used instead of multiplication. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, the final step is to replace the & with * in the SequenceMap lambda of make_sort().\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1869, "total_tokens": 6488}}, {"id": "gen-1738410957-VjoKwzqzx56XYvSas2xp", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738410957, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified that the `make_sort` function incorrectly used the bitwise AND operator `&` instead of multiplication `*` in the `SequenceMap` lambda function.

It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of elements smaller than each key.

Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each key's position in the sorted order is its index. So when we select where target_pos equals indices, each row will have a single True, so Aggregate should pick the correct value. That seems okay, but maybe there's an issue with how the selector is used.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index & max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda is x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. Oh, wait, in Python, & is a bitwise operator, not a multiplication. That's a mistake. It should be using * instead of &. So that line is incorrect.

So I need to fix that line.\n\nThen, in make_sort_freq(), it calculates hist as -1 times the histogram. Then uses make_sort with hist as keys. But wait, make_sort expects keys to be unique after modification. However, if multiple tokens have the same frequency, their hist values (which are negative counts) would be the same. So when make_sort adds min_key * index to these, it should make them unique. But I'm not sure if the current implementation handles that correctly. Also, in make_sort_freq, the function is called with rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, but the function definition only takes max_seq_len. Wait, looking back, the original make_sort_freq is defined as def make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp: but in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5). That doesn't match. Oh, wait, no, the example in the code is incorrect. The function make_sort_freq doesn't take vals and keys as arguments. So that's another issue.

So the example usage in the comment is incorrect. It should be called as sort = make_sort_freq(5), not with tokens. So that's a problem because the function doesn't accept those arguments. So the function is correct, but the example is wrong. However, the user's task is to repair the program, so perhaps the function should take tokens as an argument? Or maybe the example is just illustrative.\n\nWait, no, in the code, make_sort_freq is a function that returns an SOp, which internally uses rasp.tokens. So the function doesn't need to take tokens as an argument because it's using rasp.tokens directly. So the example in the comment is incorrect because it shows make_sort_freq being called with tokens, but the function doesn't accept them. So that's a documentation issue, but the code itself is correct.\n\nSo the main issue is in make_sort(), where the lambda uses & instead of *.

Also, in make_sort_unique, when using rasp.Aggregate, the default is None, which is correct.\n\nWait, looking at the Aggregate call in make_sort_unique: it's rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals). The default is None, which is correct as per the guidelines.\n\nSo the main fix is in make_sort(), correcting the lambda.\n\nAdditionally, in make_sort_freq(), the example in the comment is incorrect. It shows make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), but the function only takes max_seq_len. So the example should be corrected, but since the task is to repair the code, perhaps that's a separate issue.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It uses rasp.Select with EQ comparison and then applies SelectorWidth. That seems correct because it counts how many times each token appears by checking equality. So hist should return the frequency of each token. I don't see any issues here.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It creates a 'smaller' selector by checking if keys are less than each other. Then it gets the target_pos as the width of 'smaller', which gives the number of keys smaller than each position. The selector 'sel_new' is then created by selecting where target_pos equals indices. Finally, it aggregates vals using sel_new. Wait, but in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,1,2,3], right? Because each element's position in the sorted order is based on how many keys are smaller. So when we aggregate, each position picks the value where the count matches the index. That makes sense. So this function seems okay.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It modifies the keys by adding min_key * index & max_seq_len. Wait, the lambda is x + min_key * i & max_seq_len. But in Python, & is a bitwise AND, not a modulo operation. Oh, that's a problem. The intention is probably to add a unique offset to each key based on their position to ensure uniqueness. Using bitwise AND here doesn't make sense because it would limit the offset in a way that might not cover all positions, especially if max_seq_len is larger than the bits. Instead, they should use modulo max_seq_len to ensure the offset cycles correctly. So the line should be x + min_key * i % max_seq_len. That way, each position adds a unique value within the range.\n\nMoving on to make_sort_freq(). It calculates the histogram and negates it to sort by frequency. Then it calls make_sort with hist as keys, using max_seq_len and min_key=1. Wait, in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. But in make_sort_freq, the hist is negated, so lower values (more frequent) come first. However, when make_sort is called, it's using these negated hist values as keys. But in make_sort, the keys are being adjusted by adding min_key * index. Since the hist can be zero or negative, adding min_key (which is 1) times index might not correctly ensure uniqueness. Also, the min_key should be a small enough value to prevent overlapping when added to the original keys. But perhaps the main issue is in the make_sort function's key modification.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort_freq, the hist is multiplied by -1. So tokens with higher frequency have lower hist values. When sorted, they should come first. But when make_sort is called with these as keys, the sorting is based on the keys, so lower keys come first, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in make_sort, the keys are being modified by adding min_key * index. So for each token, its key becomes key + min_key * index. Since min_key is 1, each token's key is increased by its position. This ensures that if two tokens have the same key, the one with a higher index gets a higher modified key, thus appearing later. But since in make_sort_freq, the keys are the negative histogram, adding index would affect the sorting. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the intended behavior. Maybe the issue is that in make_sort_freq, the min_key should be a value that, when added as index * min_key, doesn't interfere with the original key's magnitude. But perhaps the main bug is the use of & instead of % in make_sort.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort(), the lambda uses & instead of %. It should be x + min_key * i % max_seq_len.\n\n2. In make_sort_freq(), when calling make_sort, the min_key is set to 1. But since the keys are negative hist values, adding 1 * index might not be sufficient to ensure uniqueness, especially if the hist is a large negative number. However, since max_seq_len is provided, using modulo should handle it.\n\nSo, the fix is to correct the lambda in make_sort to use modulo instead of bitwise AND.\n\nLet me check the other functions again. Are there any other issues? For example, in make_sort_unique, when using rasp.Aggregate, the default is None, which is correct. The functions seem to follow the RASP principles otherwise.\n\nSo, the main correction is in make_sort's key modification step. Changing the & to %.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4619, "completion_tokens": 1770, "total_tokens": 6389}}, {"id": "gen-1738411069-7vLgPsF2pqWwEJjgdqrA", "provider": "DeepInfra", "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1738411069, "choices": [{"logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "native_finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To repair the RASP program, we identified an issue in the `make_sort` function where a bitwise AND operation was incorrectly used instead of multiplication.

Oh, perhaps to ensure that each position's addition is unique and larger than the previous. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to scale the index so that adding it doesn't cause overlaps. For example, if min_key is 1 and max_seq_len is 5, then each position adds 0,5,10,15,20, etc., ensuring uniqueness.\n\nSo the corrected lambda should use multiplication, not bitwise AND.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_sort(), the function is called with keys = rasp.SequenceMap(...), but the original function's first parameter is 'vals', which is being shadowed. Wait, no, the function parameters are (vals, keys, ...), and inside, it's reassigning 'keys' as the modified version. So that's okay.\n\nSo the main fix is changing the & to * in the lambda.\n\nLet me also check if there are other issues.

RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
