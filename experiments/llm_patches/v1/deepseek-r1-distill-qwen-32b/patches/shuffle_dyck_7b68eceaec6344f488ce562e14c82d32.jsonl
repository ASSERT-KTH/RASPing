Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, so every element is selected. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. But wait, the SelectorWidth returns a sequence where each element is the count of True values in the corresponding row of the selector. Since all comparisons are TRUE, each row will have as many True values as the length of the sequence. So SelectorWidth should correctly give a sequence where each element is the length. But in the example, the output is [7.0, 7.0, ..., 7.0], which is correct. Hmm, maybe this function is okay.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It takes a boolean SOp and computes the fraction of previous Trues. It uses Select with LEQ to create a selector where each element selects all previous elements including itself. Then it aggregates the boolean values. Wait, but the example shows that for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]. Let me think: for each position i, it's the sum of bools up to i divided by i+1. But the current code uses LEQ, which includes the current element. So for position 0, it's just the first element, which is 0. For position 1, it's (0+0)/2=0. For position 2, (0+0+1)/3=1/3, which matches the example. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, bools is converted to numerical, which is correct because True becomes 1 and False 0. Then, prevs is a selector where each row i selects all j <= i. Then, Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0) would compute the average of the selected elements. But wait, the average is sum / count. But in the example, for position 2, the sum is 1 (only the third element is True), and count is 3, so 1/3. That's correct. So make_frac_prevs seems okay.\n\nNow, make_pair_balance(). It computes the difference between the fraction of open and close tokens. It uses make_frac_prevs for both opens and closes, then subtracts them. The example shows that for \"a()b(c))\", the output is [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]. Let me see: for each position, it's (number of opens so far / position+1) - (number of closes so far / position+1). That makes sense. So the function seems correct.\n\nFinally, make_shuffle_dyck(). This function checks if all parentheses are balanced. It computes the balance for each pair, checks if any balance is negative (meaning more closes than opens at some point), and checks if all balances are zero at the end.\n\nLooking at the code, in make_shuffle_dyck(), after computing balances for each pair, it creates any_negative by checking if any balance is less than zero. Then, it converts any_negative to numerical and uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all elements. Wait, but any_negative is a boolean SOp. When converted to numerical, True becomes 1 and False 0. Then, Aggregate with select_all (which selects all elements) would average all the 1s and 0s. But we want to know if any position has a negative balance. So if any element in any_negative is True (1), the average would be greater than zero. But the code sets has_neg as the average. However, the condition is whether any balance is negative anywhere. So if any element is True, has_neg would be non-zero. But in the code, has_neg is used as a numerical value, and then not_has_neg is the inverse. But wait, the code uses Aggregate with default=0, which returns the average. So if any element is True, the average would be positive, and has_neg would be non-zero. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse, which would be zero if any balance was negative.\n\nWait, but the code then uses last_zero, which is the balance at the last position being zero. So the final result is last_zero AND not_has_neg. That makes sense: all parentheses are closed properly (last balance is zero) and no point had a negative balance (so no excess closes).\n\nBut looking at the code, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the line:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length / 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nWait, length is an SOp that returns the length of the sequence. So for a sequence of length 4, length would be [4,4,4,4]. Then, length / 1 is the same as length. So select_last is a selector where each row i selects j where j == length[i]. But length[i] is the same for all i, equal to the sequence length. So for a sequence of length 4, each row i would select j=4, but indices are 0-based, so j=4 is out of bounds. That would result in an empty selection, and Aggregate would return the default, which is None. But in the code, last_zero is computed as Aggregate(select_last, all_zero). Since all_zero is a boolean SOp converted to numerical, and select_last selects nothing, last_zero would be None. But in the example, the output is 1 for balanced and 0 for unbalanced.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because select_last is trying to select the last element, but the way it's constructed is incorrect. Because for each i, it's comparing indices to length, which is the same for all i. So for a sequence of length 4, each row i would have j=4, which is beyond the last index (3). So the selector would have all False, meaning no elements are selected. Thus, Aggregate would return the default, which is None. But in the code, last_zero is supposed to be whether the last balance is zero. So this part is incorrect.\n\nSo the issue is in how select_last is created. Instead of comparing indices to length, which is the same for all, we should create a selector that selects the last element for each row. Alternatively, perhaps we should create a selector where for each row i, j equals the last index.\n\nWait, the correct approach is to create a selector where for each position i, it selects the last element (j = length - 1). So for a sequence of length n, each row i should select j = n-1.\n\nSo how can we create such a selector? We can create a selector where keys are indices, and queries are a constant sequence where each element is n-1. But since n varies per input, we can't hardcode it. Instead, we can compute the length using make_length(), then subtract 1, and create a selector where each row i selects j where j equals (length - 1).\n\nWait, but in RASP, we can't directly compute length - 1 as an SOp because it's a sequence. Alternatively, perhaps we can create a selector where for each i, j equals the last index.\n\nWait, another approach: the last index is equal to the length minus one. So for each i, we want to select j where j == (length - 1). But length is an SOp that returns a sequence where each element is the length. So length - 1 would be a sequence where each element is (length - 1). Then, we can create a selector where keys are indices and queries are length - 1, with EQ comparison.\n\nSo in code, we can compute last_index = rasp.Map(lambda x: x - 1, length). Then, select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, last_index, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\").\n\nWait, but in the original code, length is an SOp that returns the length for each element. So for a sequence of length 4, length would be [4,4,4,4]. Subtracting 1 would give [3,3,3,3]. So when we create the selector, for each i, j must equal 3. So the selector would have True only at j=3 for each row i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the corrected code for select_last should be:\n\nlast_index = rasp.Map(lambda x: x - 1, length).named(\"last_index\")\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, last_index, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nThen, last_zero = rasp.Aggregate(select_last, all_zero).named(\"last_zero\")\n\nThis way, for each row i, it selects j=3 (for length 4), and aggregates the value at j=3, which is whether all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nAnother issue: in the original code, any_negative is created by OR-ing all the balances being less than zero. But any_negative is a boolean SOp. Then, it's converted to numerical, which is correct. But when using Aggregate with select_all, which selects all elements, the average would be the fraction of positions where any_negative is True. However, we need to check if any position has any_negative True. So if any element is True, the result should be True. But using Aggregate with average would return a value greater than zero if any element is True. Then, has_neg is this average. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse, which would be zero if any element is True.\n\nWait, but in the code, has_neg is used as a numerical value, and then not_has_neg is (~has_neg). But if has_neg is a float, then ~ would be bitwise NOT, which is incorrect. Wait, no, because in the code, any_negative is converted to numerical, which is 1 or 0. Then, Aggregate returns the average, which is a float. So has_neg is a float. Then, not_has_neg is (~has_neg), but ~ on a float would give a negative number, which is not intended.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because ~ is the bitwise NOT operator, which for floats may not behave as expected. Instead, we should compute whether has_neg is zero or not. If has_neg is greater than zero, then not_has_neg should be False (0), else True (1). So perhaps we should compute not_has_neg as (has_neg == 0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should avoid using ~ and instead use a comparison.\n\nSo in the code, after computing has_neg, which is the average of any_negative, we can create not_has_neg as (has_neg == 0). But since has_neg is a numerical SOp, we can do:\n\nnot_has_neg = (has_neg == 0).named(\"not_has_neg\")\n\nBut wait, in the original code, any_negative is converted to numerical, then aggregated. So has_neg is a float. If any element in any_negative is True (1), then the average would be >= 1/(length), which is >0. So has_neg > 0 indicates that at least one position had a negative balance. So not_has_neg should be 1 only if has_neg == 0.\n\nSo the corrected code would be:\n\nany_negative = ... # as before\nhas_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\"has_neg\")\nnot_has_neg = (has_neg == 0).named(\"not_has_neg\")\n\nBut in the original code, not_has_neg is computed as (~has_neg).named(\"not_has_neg\"), which is incorrect because ~ operates on integers, not floats, and would give unexpected results.\n\nSo that's another issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the select_last selector is incorrectly constructed, leading to selecting nothing. It should select the last index for each row.\n\n2. The computation of not_has_neg is incorrect because it uses ~ on a float, which is not the intended logical NOT.\n\nSo to fix these:\n\n- Correct the select_last construction by using the length minus one.\n\n- Compute not_has_neg correctly by checking if has_neg is zero.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that all operations adhere to RASP's constraints, such as not using loops or conditionals dependent on input elements, and using only the allowed operations.\n\nAnother thing to check: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the initial any_negative is created by OR-ing all the balances. But each balance is an SOp, so the OR operation is correct as it combines the conditions.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is created as balances[0] < 0, then for each balance in balances[1:], any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0). This correctly creates a boolean SOp where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position.\n\nThen, any_negative is converted to numerical, which is correct.\n\nSo the main fixes are in make_shuffle_dyck().\n\nLet me outline the steps to fix:\n\n1. In make_shuffle_dyck(), compute last_index as length - 1.\n\n2. Create select_last using rasp.Select with keys as indices and queries as last_index, using EQ.\n\n3. Compute last_zero as the Aggregate of select_last on all_zero.\n\n4. Compute has_neg as the Aggregate of select_all on any_negative.\n\n5. Compute not_has_neg as (has_neg == 0).\n\n6. The final result is last_zero AND not_has_neg.\n\nWait, but last_zero is a boolean SOp (from all_zero being True at the last position), and not_has_neg is a boolean SOp (has_neg == 0). So the final result is their logical AND.\n\nBut in the original code, the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"). However, last_zero is computed as Aggregate(select_last, all_zero), which returns a numerical value (average). So if all_zero is True at the last position, the average would be 1.0, else 0.0. Similarly, has_neg is the average of any_negative, which is 1 if any position had a negative balance.\n\nWait, no. any_negative is a boolean SOp where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position. Then, Aggregate with select_all (which selects all elements) would compute the average of these booleans (converted to 1s and 0s). So has_neg is the fraction of positions where any balance was negative. If any position had a negative balance, has_neg would be >0.\n\nBut we need to check if any position had a negative balance. So has_neg > 0 indicates that. So not_has_neg should be 1 only if has_neg == 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\nhas_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\"has_neg\")\nnot_has_neg = (has_neg == 0).named(\"not_has_neg\")\n\nThen, the final result is last_zero AND not_has_neg.\n\nBut last_zero is computed as Aggregate(select_last, all_zero), which is the average of all_zero at the last position. Since all_zero is a boolean SOp where each element is True only if all balances are zero at that position, the Aggregate would return 1.0 if all_zero is True at the last position, else 0.0.\n\nSo last_zero is a numerical SOp indicating whether all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nThus, the final result is last_zero AND not_has_neg, which is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_shuffle_dyck() function should:\n\n- Compute last_index as length - 1.\n\n- Create select_last using indices and last_index with EQ.\n\n- Compute last_zero as Aggregate(select_last, all_zero).\n\n- Compute has_neg as Aggregate(select_all, any_negative).\n\n- Compute not_has_neg as (has_neg == 0).\n\n- Return last_zero AND not_has_neg.\n\nWait, but in RASP, the AND operation is done via selector_and, but in the code, it's using the & operator on SOps. Wait, no, in the code, last_zero and not_has_neg are numerical SOps (floats), so using & would perform a bitwise AND, which is incorrect. Instead, we should convert them to boolean SOps and then perform a logical AND.\n\nWait, but in the code, last_zero is a numerical SOp (from Aggregate), which returns a float. Similarly, not_has_neg is a boolean SOp (from has_neg == 0). Wait, no: has_neg is a numerical SOp, so has_neg == 0 is a boolean SOp. So not_has_neg is a boolean SOp.\n\nWait, no: has_neg is a numerical SOp (from Aggregate), which is a float. Then, (has_neg == 0) is a boolean comparison, resulting in a boolean SOp. So not_has_neg is a boolean SOp.\n\nSimilarly, last_zero is a numerical SOp (from Aggregate), which is a float. To convert it to a boolean, we can check if it's equal to 1.0, but perhaps it's better to create a boolean SOp from it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should ensure that last_zero is a boolean SOp. Because all_zero is a boolean SOp, and select_last selects the last element, the Aggregate would return 1.0 if all_zero is True at the last position, else 0.0. So last_zero is a numerical SOp indicating whether the last position is all zero.\n\nSo to combine last_zero and not_has_neg, which are numerical and boolean respectively, we need to convert them appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute last_zero as a boolean SOp. Because all_zero is a boolean SOp, and select_last selects the last element, the Aggregate would return 1.0 if the last element is True, else 0.0. So last_zero is a numerical SOp where each element is 1.0 if the last balance is zero, else 0.0.\n\nSimilarly, not_has_neg is a boolean SOp where each element is True if has_neg is zero (i.e., no negative balances).\n\nSo to combine them, we can convert last_zero to a boolean by checking if it's equal to 1.0.\n\nSo:\n\nlast_zero_bool = (last_zero == 1.0).named(\"last_zero_bool\")\nnot_has_neg = (has_neg == 0).named(\"not_has_neg\")\nresult = last_zero_bool & not_has_neg\n\nBut in the original code, the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"), which is incorrect because last_zero is a numerical SOp and not_has_neg is a boolean SOp. The & operator would perform a bitwise AND on the numerical values, which is not the intended logical AND.\n\nSo the correct approach is to convert last_zero to a boolean SOp and then perform the logical AND.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the final result as the product of last_zero and not_has_neg, but that might not be accurate because 1.0 * True would be 1.0, which is considered True, but we need a boolean result.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is 1 for balanced and 0 for unbalanced. So perhaps the final result should be a"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    #
