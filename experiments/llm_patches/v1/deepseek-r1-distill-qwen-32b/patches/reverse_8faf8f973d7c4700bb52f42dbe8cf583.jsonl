Let me look at the code and understand what's going on.\n\nThe program has two functions: make_length() and make_reverse(). The goal is to create SOps that compute the length of the input sequence and reverse it, respectively.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The current implementation uses Select with Comparison.TRUE, which should create a selector where every element is True. Then, SelectorWidth counts the number of True values per row, which should give the length. But wait, when I run this, does it correctly compute the length?\n\nWait, the example shows that when the input is \"abcdefg\", the output is [7.0, 7.0, ..., 7.0]. That makes sense because each element in the output is the length. But how does SelectorWidth work here? The Select operation with TRUE would create a selector where every position is True for all elements. So SelectorWidth would count the number of True values per row, which is the length of the sequence. That seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's an issue with the data types. The example shows the output as floats, but the code returns integers. Oh, but in RASP, when you aggregate, if all are selected, it's just the average, which is the same as the value. Wait, no, in this case, SelectorWidth returns the count, which is an integer. But the example expects floats. Hmm, perhaps the code is correct, but the example is just illustrative.\n\nMoving on to make_reverse(). The current code tries to create a reversed index. Let's see:\n\nopp_idx is calculated as length - indices - 1. For a sequence of length 7, indices are [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]. So length is 7, so opp_idx would be 7 - index -1, which is 6 - index. So for index 0, opp_idx is 6; index 1, 5; etc. Then, reverse_selector is created by selecting where indices -1 equals opp_idx. Wait, indices -1 would be [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Opp_idx is [6,5,4,3,2,1,0]. So comparing indices-1 == opp_idx would only be true when, for example, index 6: indices-1 is 5, opp_idx is 0. That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe the logic is flawed. The idea is to create a selector where each position i selects the element at position (length - 1 - i). So for i=0, select the last element; for i=1, select the second last, etc.\n\nBut the current code uses Select with keys as indices-1 and queries as opp_idx, and EQ comparison. So for each row i, it's checking if (i-1) equals opp_idx[i]. That doesn't seem correct because opp_idx is computed per element, not per row.\n\nWait, perhaps the way Select works is that for each element in the queries, it's compared to each element in the keys. So when we do Select(keys, queries, EQ), it creates a selector matrix where selector[i][j] is True if keys[j] == queries[i]. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.\n\nIn the example given in the problem statement, when using Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, GT), the selector is a matrix where each row i has True for columns j where tokens[j] > tokens[i]. So for each query (row i), it's comparing against all keys (columns j).\n\nSo in make_reverse(), the current code is creating a selector where for each query (row i), it's looking for keys (columns j) where (indices - 1)[i] == opp_idx[j]. Wait, no, because keys are indices-1, which is a sequence, and queries are opp_idx, which is another sequence. So for each i, the query is opp_idx[i], and the keys are indices-1[j] for each j. So selector[i][j] is True if (indices-1)[j] == opp_idx[i].\n\nWait, that's not what we want. We want for each position i in the output, to select the element at position (length - 1 - i) from the input. So for i=0, select j = length-1; for i=1, j = length-2, etc.\n\nSo the correct approach is to create a selector where for each row i, the only True is at column j = length - 1 - i.\n\nHow can we achieve that? Let's think about the keys and queries.\n\nWe can set the keys to be the indices, and the queries to be (length - 1 - indices). Then, using EQ comparison, each row i will have True only at j = length -1 -i.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nkeys = indices: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]\nqueries = length -1 - indices: [6,5,4,3,2,1,0]\n\nSo for each i, query is 6 - i. So for row i=0, query is 6. We compare keys[j] == 6, which is True only at j=6. So selector[0][6] = True.\n\nFor row i=1, query is 5. So selector[1][5] = True.\n\nAnd so on. That's exactly what we need.\n\nSo in the current code, the keys are indices -1, which is [-1,0,1,2,3,4,5], and queries are opp_idx, which is [6,5,4,3,2,1,0]. So for row i=0, query is 6. We're checking if keys[j] == 6. But keys[j] are [-1,0,1,2,3,4,5], so none are 6. So selector[0][j] is all False, which is incorrect.\n\nAh, that's the bug. The current code is using indices -1 as keys, which shifts everything down by one, causing the comparison to fail for the first element.\n\nSo to fix make_reverse(), we should set keys to be indices, and queries to be (length - 1 - indices). Then, using EQ, each row i will select j = length -1 -i.\n\nSo the corrected code for make_reverse() would be:\n\nopp_idx = (length - 1 - rasp.indices).named(\"opp_idx\")\nreverse_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, opp_idx, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"reverse_selector\")\n\nWait, but in the current code, opp_idx is computed as length - indices -1, which is correct. But the keys are indices -1, which is wrong. So we need to change that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute opp_idx as length - 1 - indices. This gives the correct target indices for each position.\n\n2. Create a selector where for each row i, the query is opp_idx[i], and the keys are indices[j]. So when we do Select(keys=indices, queries=opp_idx, predicate=EQ), each row i will have True only at j = opp_idx[i].\n\nThus, the corrected code should be:\n\ndef make_reverse(sop: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Create an SOp that reverses a sequence, using length primitive.\"\"\"\n    opp_idx = (length - 1 - rasp.indices).named(\"opp_idx\")\n    reverse_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, opp_idx, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"reverse_selector\")\n    return rasp.Aggregate(reverse_selector, sop).named(\"reverse\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, they had (length - indices).named(\"opp_idx\"), then subtracted 1. So opp_idx was length - indices -1. Which is the same as (length -1) - indices. So that part is correct.\n\nBut the keys were indices -1, which is wrong. They should be indices.\n\nSo the corrected code changes the keys from (indices -1) to indices.\n\nAdditionally, in the original code, after creating opp_idx, they subtract 1 again, which would make it length - indices -2, which is incorrect. So that line should be removed.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nopp_idx = (length - rasp.indices).named(\"opp_idx\")\nopp_idx = (opp_idx - 1).named(\"opp_idx-1\")\n\nSo opp_idx becomes (length - indices -1), which is correct. So that part is okay.\n\nBut the keys are (rasp.indices -1), which is wrong. So the Select should use keys=rasp.indices, not (rasp.indices -1).\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected make_reverse() function should compute opp_idx as (length - indices -1), then create a selector where keys are indices and queries are opp_idx, using EQ.\n\nThus, the corrected code is:\n\ndef make_reverse(sop: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Create an SOp that reverses a sequence, using length primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      reverse = make_reverse(rasp.tokens)\n      reverse(\"Hello\")\n      >> ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'H']\n\n    Args:\n      sop: an SOp\n\n    Returns:\n      reverse : SOp that reverses the input sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    opp_idx = (length - rasp.indices - 1).named(\"opp_idx\")\n    reverse_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, opp_idx, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"reverse_selector\")\n    return rasp.Aggregate(reverse_selector, sop).named(\"reverse\")\n\nWait, but in the original code, they had two lines for opp_idx. Let me see:\n\nopp_idx = (length - rasp.indices).named(\"opp_idx\")\nopp_idx = (opp_idx - 1).named(\"opp_idx-1\")\n\nWhich is equivalent to opp_idx = length - indices -1. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the corrected code, I can compute it in one step for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, keep it as two steps for readability.\n\nSo the final code for make_reverse() is as above.\n\nTesting this, for a sequence of length 7:\n\nindices = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]\nopp_idx = 6 - indices = [6,5,4,3,2,1,0]\n\nSo for each row i, the query is opp_idx[i], which is 6 -i.\n\nThe keys are indices[j] = j.\n\nSo selector[i][j] is True when j == 6 -i.\n\nThus, for i=0, j=6 is True.\n\nFor i=1, j=5 is True.\n\nAnd so on, which correctly reverses the sequence.\n\nSo the main issue was using indices -1 as keys, which shifted everything and caused the selector to not pick the correct elements. By using indices as keys, the selector works as intended.\n\nAnother thing to check is the use of Aggregate. Since each row has exactly one True, Aggregate will pick that element without averaging, which is correct.\n\nSo the repaired code should fix the keys in the Select operation and adjust the computation of opp_idx correctly.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4218, "completion_tokens": 2784, "total_tokens": 7002}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_reverse(sop: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Create an SOp that reverses a sequence, using length primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      reverse = make_reverse(rasp.tokens)\n      reverse(\"Hello\")\n      >> ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'H']\n\n    Args:\n      sop: an SOp\n\n    Returns:\n      reverse : SOp that reverses the input sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    opp_idx = (length - rasp.indices).named(\"opp_idx\")\n    opp_idx = (opp_idx - 1).named(\"opp_idx-1\")\n    reverse_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.indices - 1, opp_idx, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"reverse_selector\"\n    )\n    return rasp.Aggregate(reverse_selector, sop).named(\"reverse\")\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.0}
