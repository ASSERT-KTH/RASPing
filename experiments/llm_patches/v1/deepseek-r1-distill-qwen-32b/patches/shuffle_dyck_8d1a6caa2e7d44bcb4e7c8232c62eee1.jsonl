Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. Since all are True, each row's width should be the length of the sequence. So when we evaluate, each element becomes the length. That seems correct. Maybe no issue here.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It uses Select with LEQ to get previous indices. Then aggregates bools. But wait, the Select uses indices as keys and queries. So for each position i, it selects all j <= i. Then Aggregate averages the bools up to i. But the example shows for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]. Let me see: for position 2 (third element), it's considering the first three elements. The bools are [False, False, True], so sum is 1, count is 3, so 1/3. That matches. So maybe this is correct. But wait, the function returns numerical(Aggregate(... default=0)). But in the example, the first element is 0, which is correct because there are no previous elements. So perhaps this is okay.\n\nLooking at make_pair_balance(). It computes frac_prevs for open and close tokens, then subtracts them. The example shows for \"a()b(c))\", the output is [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]. Let me check: for each position, it's (open_prevs - close_prevs). For position 1 (second element), open_prevs is 1/2 (since one '(', total 2 elements so far), close_prevs is 0, so 1/2. That seems correct. So maybe this function is okay.\n\nNow, make_shuffle_dyck(). The goal is to return 1 if all parentheses are balanced, else 0. The current implementation checks two things: whether any balance is negative (indicating more closes than opens at some point) and whether the final balance is zero.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\n1. It computes balances for each pair.\n2. any_negative is True if any balance is negative anywhere.\n3. has_neg is the aggregate of any_negative, which averages the values. Wait, but any_negative is a boolean SOp. When we aggregate with select_all, which selects all positions, it's taking the average of 1s and 0s. So has_neg becomes 1 if any position has a negative balance, else 0. But wait, the Aggregate function averages, so if any_negative has a 1 in any position, the average will be >= 1/(sequence length). So when we check if has_neg is non-zero, it indicates there was at least one negative balance.\n\nThen, all_zero checks if all balances are zero at the end. select_last selects the last element, and last_zero is the value of all_zero at the last position. So last_zero is 1 if all balances are zero at the end.\n\nFinally, the result is last_zero AND (not has_neg). So it's 1 only if both conditions are met: no negatives anywhere and all balances are zero at the end.\n\nBut wait, in the example given:\n\nFor \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1]. Let's see:\n\nEach pair's balance:\n\nFor \"()\", the balance would be 1 at position 2, then 0 at position 4.\nFor \"{}\", balance is 1 at position 3, then 0 at position 4.\n\nBut in the string \"({)}\", the parentheses are actually unbalanced because the closing order is wrong. Wait, no, \"({)}\" is actually balanced if each pair is properly closed. Wait, no, \"({)}\" is \"(\", \"{\", \")\", \"}\". So the first \"(\" is closed by the third \")\", and the second \"{\" is closed by the fourth \"}\". So it's balanced. So the output should be 1s.\n\nBut according to the code, any_negative would be 0 because no balance goes negative. last_zero would be 1 because all balances are zero at the end. So the result is 1.\n\nAnother example: \"(){)}\" should return 0s. Let's see:\n\nThe string is \"(\", \")\", \"(\", \")\", \")\".\n\nFor \"()\", the balance goes 1, 0, 1, 0, -1 (because the last \")\" closes the third \"(\", but there's nothing to close, so balance becomes -1.\n\nSo any_negative would be 1 because the last balance is -1. So has_neg is 1. last_zero is 0 because the final balance is -1, which is not zero. So the result is 0.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is computed as balances[0] < 0 OR balances[1] < 0. So if any balance is negative at any position, any_negative is True. Then has_neg is the average of any_negative across all positions. So if any position has any_negative as True (1), has_neg will be non-zero.\n\nBut in the code, the final result is (last_zero AND NOT has_neg). So if has_neg is non-zero (meaning any balance was negative), NOT has_neg is False, so the result is 0.\n\nWait, but in the code, has_neg is computed as Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0). Since any_negative is a boolean SOp, when we aggregate, it's averaging the 1s and 0s. So if any position has any_negative as True (1), the average will be >= 1/(length). So has_neg will be non-zero if any balance was negative.\n\nBut in the code, the final result is (last_zero & ~has_neg). So if has_neg is non-zero, ~has_neg is False, so the result is 0.\n\nWait, but in the code, has_neg is numerical(Aggregate(...)). So it's a numerical value. Then, ~has_neg is the boolean NOT of has_neg. So if has_neg is non-zero, ~has_neg is False.\n\nSo the final result is 1 only if last_zero is True AND has_neg is zero.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg). But last_zero is an SOp that is 1 if all balances are zero at the end, and ~has_neg is 1 only if has_neg is zero (i.e., no negatives anywhere). So the AND of these two would be 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nBut in the code, the way it's written, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"). But wait, last_zero is an SOp of boolean values (from all_zero), and ~has_neg is also a boolean. So their AND is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is created as balances[0] < 0, then for each balance in balances[1:], any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0). So any_negative is a boolean SOp that is True at any position where any balance is negative.\n\nThen, has_neg is the numerical aggregate of any_negative across all positions. So if any_negative has any True (1), the average will be non-zero. So has_neg is non-zero if any balance was negative at any position.\n\nThen, ~has_neg is True only if has_neg is zero, meaning no balance was negative.\n\nSo the final result is last_zero (all balances zero at end) AND ~has_neg (no negatives anywhere). So the result is 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg). But last_zero is an SOp of boolean values, and ~has_neg is also a boolean. So their AND is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"). But in the example given, when the input is \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1], which is correct because the parentheses are balanced. When the input is \"(){)}\", the output is [0,0,0,0,0], which is correct because the last parenthesis causes a negative balance.\n\nSo why is the user saying that the program is incorrect? Maybe the issue is with how the final result is computed.\n\nWait, looking back at the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg). But in RASP, the & operator is for selectors, not for numerical SOps. Wait, no, in the code, last_zero is an SOp, and ~has_neg is also an SOp. So using & might not be the correct way to combine them.\n\nWait, in the code, any_negative is created as a boolean SOp. Then, has_neg is the numerical aggregate, which is a float. Then, ~has_neg is the boolean NOT of has_neg, which would be True if has_neg is zero.\n\nBut in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg). But last_zero is a boolean SOp, and ~has_neg is also a boolean SOp. So using & would perform element-wise AND.\n\nWait, but in the code, last_zero is created as rasp.Aggregate(select_last, all_zero). So all_zero is a boolean SOp that is True where all balances are zero. select_last selects the last element, so last_zero is the value of all_zero at the last position. So last_zero is a boolean SOp where each element is the same as the last element of all_zero.\n\nWait, no. Because select_last is a selector that selects the last element. So when we aggregate, it takes the value of all_zero at the last position and applies it to all positions. So last_zero is an SOp where every element is the value of all_zero at the last position.\n\nSimilarly, has_neg is the average of any_negative across all positions. So if any_negative is True at any position, has_neg is non-zero.\n\nSo the final result is last_zero (which is True if all balances are zero at the end) AND ~has_neg (which is True if no balance was negative anywhere). So the result is 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg). But last_zero is an SOp of booleans, and ~has_neg is also an SOp of booleans. So their AND is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"). But in the example given, when the input is \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1], which is correct. When the input is \"(){)}\", the output is [0,0,0,0,0], which is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the function returns (last_zero & ~has_neg). But in RASP, the & operator is for selectors, not for numerical SOps. Wait, no, in the code, last_zero and ~has_neg are both boolean SOps, so their & is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is created as balances[0] < 0, which is a boolean SOp. Then, for each balance in balances[1:], any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0). So any_negative is a boolean SOp that is True at any position where any balance is negative.\n\nThen, has_neg is the numerical aggregate of any_negative across all positions. So if any_negative has any True (1), the average will be non-zero. So has_neg is non-zero if any balance was negative.\n\nThen, ~has_neg is True only if has_neg is zero, meaning no balance was negative.\n\nSo the final result is last_zero (all balances zero at end) AND ~has_neg (no negatives anywhere). So the result is 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nWait, but in the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg). But last_zero is an SOp of booleans, and ~has_neg is also a boolean. So their AND is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the final result should be a numerical SOp, but the code is returning a boolean. Because in the example, the output is [1,1,1,1], which are integers, not booleans. So maybe the final result should be cast to numerical.\n\nLooking at the code, the final return is (last_zero & ~has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\"). But last_zero is a boolean SOp, and ~has_neg is also a boolean. So their AND is a boolean SOp. But the example expects numerical outputs (1s and 0s). So perhaps the final result should be converted to numerical.\n\nSo the fix would be to wrap the final result in rasp.numerical().\n\nAnother possible issue: in the code, any_negative is created as a boolean SOp, then converted to numerical with rasp.numerical(). But when we aggregate, it's summing 1s and 0s, so has_neg is the fraction of positions where any_negative was True. But in the code, has_neg is used as a boolean, but it's actually a float. So when we do ~has_neg, it's checking if the float is zero. But if has_neg is, say, 0.2, then ~has_neg is False, which is correct because it means there were some negatives.\n\nWait, but in the code, any_negative is converted to numerical, which is correct because Aggregate expects numerical values. So that part is okay.\n\nSo the main issue is that the final result is a boolean SOp, but the example expects numerical outputs. So we need to convert it to numerical.\n\nSo in the code, the final return should be rasp.numerical(last_zero & ~has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\").\n\nWait, but last_zero is a boolean SOp, and ~has_neg is also a boolean. So their AND is a boolean SOp. Converting it to numerical would turn True into 1 and False into 0, which matches the example.\n\nSo that's the fix: wrap the final result in rasp.numerical().\n\nAnother possible issue: in the code, select_last is created as rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length * 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ). But length is an SOp that returns the length of the sequence. So length * 1 is the same as length. But when we evaluate, for each position i, it's comparing i to the length, which is beyond the sequence. Wait, no, because the sequence length is n, indices are 0 to n-1. So comparing i == n would be False for all i. So select_last would be all False, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because select_last is supposed to select the last element. So for a sequence of length 4, indices are 0,1,2,3. The last index is 3. So to select the last element, the selector should have True only at position 3.\n\nBut the current code uses length * 1, which for a sequence of length 4, would be 4. So the comparison is i == 4, which is False for all i (0-3). So select_last is all False, which means last_zero would be the default value, which is None. But in the code, last_zero is created as rasp.Aggregate(select_last, all_zero). So if select_last is all False, Aggregate returns the default, which is None. But in the code, last_zero is used in the final result, which would cause issues.\n\nWait, that's a big problem. So the select_last is incorrectly selecting nothing. So the code is wrong here.\n\nSo how to correctly select the last element? We need a selector where for each row i, it's True only when i equals the last index.\n\nThe last index is length - 1. So we need to create a selector where keys are indices, queries are length - 1, and the predicate is EQ.\n\nSo the correct select_last should be:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.Map(lambda x: x - 1, length), rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nWait, but length is an SOp that returns a sequence where each element is the length. So for a sequence of length 4, length.eval() returns [4,4,4,4]. So if we subtract 1, we get [3,3,3,3]. So the queries are 3 for all positions. Then, the selector compares each index i (0,1,2,3) to 3. So only the last row (i=3) will have True in the last column.\n\nWait, no. Because the selector is created as keys=indices, queries=map(x-1, length). So for each position i, the query is 3. So the selector matrix will have True only at (i, j) where j == 3. So for each row i, the selector is True only at column 3.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because we want to select the last element, which is at position length-1. So for each row i, we want to select the element at position j = length-1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to create a selector where for each row i, the selector is True only at j = length-1.\n\nBut how to do that in RASP.\n\nAlternative approach: create a selector where keys are indices, queries are length-1, and predicate is EQ.\n\nSo:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(\n    keys=rasp.indices,\n    queries=rasp.Map(lambda x: x - 1, length),\n    predicate=rasp.Comparison.EQ\n).named(\"select_last\")\n\nThis way, for each i, it's checking if i equals (length-1). So only the last row will have a True in the last column.\n\nWait, no. Because for each row i, the query is (length-1), which is the same for all rows. So for row i, the selector will have True only at column j where j == (length-1). So for all rows, the selector is True only at the last column.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because we want to select the last element, which is at position length-1. So for each row i, we want to select the element at position j = length-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to have the queries be a sequence where each element is length-1. So for a sequence of length 4, the queries are [3,3,3,3]. Then, the selector compares each index i (0,1,2,3) to 3. So the selector matrix will have True only at (i,3) for each row i.\n\nBut when we aggregate with this selector, for each row i, it will take the value at j=3. So last_zero will be the value of all"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    #
