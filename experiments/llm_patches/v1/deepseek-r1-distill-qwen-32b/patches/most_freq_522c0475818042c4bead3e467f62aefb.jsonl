Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). It's supposed to count how many times each token occurs. The current code uses Select with EQ on tokens, then SelectorWidth. Wait, but SelectorWidth counts the number of True values in each row. So for each position, it's counting how many tokens are equal to it. That should work, right? Hmm, maybe not. Because if the tokens are not unique, it might count all occurrences. Let me test with the example: input \"abac\" should give [2,1,2,1]. Let's see, same_tok would be a selector where each row i has True for all j where token j equals token i. So for \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\", the selector for each row would have Trues where the token matches. Then SelectorWidth would sum those Trues for each row, giving the count of each token in the entire sequence. So yes, that should work. Maybe the issue is elsewhere.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys, assuming unique keys. The code creates a 'smaller' selector where keys are less than each other. Then target_pos is the SelectorWidth of smaller, which gives for each position the number of keys less than it. Then sel_new is a selector where target_pos equals the index. Wait, that might not correctly map the positions. Because target_pos is a sequence where each element is the count of keys less than the current key. So for each position i, target_pos[i] is the number of keys less than keys[i]. Then sel_new is selecting where target_pos equals the index. But indices start at 0, so for the smallest key, target_pos would be 0, which would map to index 0. The next key would have target_pos 1, mapping to index 1, etc. That should correctly sort the keys and then aggregate the vals in that order. But wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the target_pos would be [0, 2, 1, 0]. Then sel_new would be a selector where target_pos equals the index. So for index 0, target_pos is 0 \u2192 True. For index 1, target_pos is 2 \u2192 False. For index 2, target_pos is 1 \u2192 False. For index 3, target_pos is 0 \u2192 False. So the selector would have True only at (0,0). That doesn't seem right. Oh, I see the problem. The target_pos is the rank, but the indices are 0-based. So for the sorted order, each key's rank should determine its new position. But the current approach might not correctly handle this because it's trying to map each key's rank to its index, which doesn't account for multiple keys having the same rank.\n\nWait, in the example, keys are [2,4,3,1]. The 'smaller' selector would have for each i, j where keys[j] < keys[i]. So for i=0 (key=2), j=3 (key=1) is less. So target_pos[0] is 1. For i=1 (key=4), j=0,2,3 are less, so target_pos[1]=3. For i=2 (key=3), j=0,3 are less, target_pos[2]=2. For i=3 (key=1), no j is less, target_pos[3]=0. So target_pos is [1,3,2,0]. Then sel_new is selecting where target_pos equals the index. So for each row i, it looks for j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=3. For i=1, j=0. For i=2, j=2. For i=3, j=1. So the selector would have True at (0,3), (1,0), (2,2), (3,1). Then when aggregating vals with this selector, each row i would take the val at j where target_pos[j] == i. So the output would be [vals[3], vals[0], vals[2], vals[1]], which is [1,2,3,4]. That works. So maybe the issue is when keys are not unique. But make_sort_unique is supposed to handle unique keys, so perhaps it's correct.\n\nNow, looking at make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them to be unique using max_seq_len and min_key. The code modifies the keys by subtracting min_key * index / max_seq_len. But wait, in the example, when keys are [2,4,1,2], after adjustment, they become unique. Then make_sort_unique is called. But in the example, the output is [1,2,2,4], which suggests that the two 2's are kept in their original order. However, the current code might not handle ties correctly because the adjustment could cause the keys to not be in the correct order. Let me see: for [2,4,1,2], the indices are [0,1,2,3]. So adjusted keys would be 2 - 1*0/5=2, 4 -1*1/5=3.8, 1 -1*2/5=0.6, 2 -1*3/5=1.4. So the adjusted keys are [2, 3.8, 0.6, 1.4]. Sorting these would give 0.6, 1.4, 2, 3.8, which correspond to the original keys 1,2,2,4. So the output would be [1,2,2,4], which is correct. So perhaps the issue is not here.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It's supposed to sort tokens by their frequency, with ties broken by their original order. The code computes hist as -1 * make_hist(), then calls make_sort with hist as keys. Wait, but make_sort expects keys to be numerical. However, hist is the count of each token. But when we pass hist as keys, we're using the negative frequency, so higher frequencies become more negative, which when sorted in ascending order would come first. Wait, no: because in make_sort, the keys are adjusted, but the sort is based on the adjusted keys. Let me see: hist is -count, so higher counts become more negative. So when sorted in ascending order, the most frequent tokens (most negative) come first. But in the example, input [2,4,2,1], the hist is [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The adjusted keys would be -2 - 1*0/5 = -2, -1 -1*1/5=-1.2, -2 -1*2/5=-2.4, -1 -1*3/5=-1.6. So the adjusted keys are [-2, -1.2, -2.4, -1.6]. Sorting these in ascending order would give -2.4, -2, -1.6, -1.2. The corresponding original vals are 2,4,2,1. Wait, no: the vals are the tokens, which are [2,4,2,1]. So the sorted order based on adjusted keys would be the order of the keys: the smallest adjusted key is -2.4 (position 2), then -2 (position 0), then -1.6 (position 3), then -1.2 (position 1). So the output would be [2,2,1,4], but the example expects [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So the issue is that the current code isn't correctly handling the frequency sorting with original order preservation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the keys are being adjusted in a way that doesn't preserve the original order for ties. Because when frequencies are the same, the adjusted keys might not maintain the original positions correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the way the keys are being adjusted is causing the sort to not respect the original order for tokens with the same frequency.\n\nAnother issue I notice is in make_sort_freq(), the function is defined as make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp, but in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function should take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort(). So the current definition is incorrect. It should probably be make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp.\n\nAlso, in make_sort_freq(), the code returns make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, ...), but it should be using the vals parameter instead of rasp.tokens, because the function is supposed to sort the vals based on the frequency of the keys.\n\nSo putting it all together, the issues are:\n\n1. In make_sort_freq(), the function signature is incorrect; it should take vals and keys as arguments.\n2. The keys adjustment in make_sort() might not correctly handle the original order when frequencies are the same.\n3. In make_sort_freq(), the code uses rasp.tokens instead of the provided vals.\n\nTo fix make_sort_freq(), I'll adjust the function signature and use the provided vals. Also, ensure that the keys are adjusted correctly to maintain the original order for ties.\n\nAnother thing: in make_hist(), the SelectorWidth of same_tok gives the count for each token in the entire sequence. But when using this as keys in make_sort(), each position's key is the count of its token. So when sorting, tokens with higher counts come first. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which suggests that the two 2's are first, followed by 4, then 1. So the code should correctly handle that.\n\nWait, but in the current make_sort_freq(), the keys are set to hist, which is the frequency count. So when we sort vals by keys (frequency), higher frequencies come first. But in the example, the frequencies are [2,1,2,1], so the keys are [2,1,2,1]. After adjustment, they become unique, and the sort should order them as 2,2,1,1, but the vals are [2,4,2,1], so the output should be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So perhaps the issue is that the current code in make_sort_freq() is not correctly using the vals parameter.\n\nSo, to fix make_sort_freq(), I'll adjust the function to take vals and keys, and use vals in the return statement.\n\nAnother potential issue is in make_sort_unique(). The current code might not handle cases where multiple keys have the same rank correctly because the target_pos could have the same value for different keys, leading to incorrect aggregation.\n\nWait, in make_sort_unique(), the target_pos is the number of keys less than the current key. So for keys [2,2,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,0,2,0]. Then sel_new is where target_pos equals the index. So for index 0, target_pos is 0 \u2192 True for j=0 and j=1 and j=3. So the selector would have multiple Trues in row 0, which when aggregated would average the vals at those positions. But we don't want averaging; we want to select the vals in the order of their ranks. So the current approach might not work correctly for duplicate keys because it would aggregate multiple vals into one position, leading to incorrect results.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that make_sort_unique() doesn't handle ties correctly, and thus make_sort() which relies on it also has issues.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps a better approach is needed for make_sort_unique(). Instead of using target_pos as the rank, maybe we need to create a selector that for each position i, selects the j with the i-th smallest key. This might require a different approach, such as using multiple selectors or ensuring that each key is mapped to a unique position based on their rank and original order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current implementation works for unique keys but fails when there are duplicates, which is why the make_sort() function was adjusted to handle non-unique keys by making them unique. But in make_sort_freq(), when frequencies are the same, the original order should be preserved, which the current code might not handle correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. make_sort_freq() has incorrect function signature and uses rasp.tokens instead of vals.\n2. make_sort_unique() may not handle ties correctly, leading to incorrect aggregation.\n3. The adjustment of keys in make_sort() might not correctly preserve the original order for tokens with the same frequency.\n\nTo fix these:\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n\n- Change the function signature to accept vals and keys.\n- Use vals in the return statement instead of rasp.tokens.\n\nFor make_sort_unique():\n\n- The current approach may not correctly handle ties because the target_pos can have the same value for multiple keys, leading to multiple Trues in the selector for the same row. This causes the Aggregate to average the vals, which is not desired. Instead, we need to ensure that each row selects exactly one val, in the correct order.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to create a selector where for each position i, it selects the j with the i-th smallest key. This can be done by creating a selector that for each i, selects the j where the key is the i-th smallest, considering the original order for ties.\n\nBut implementing this in RASP might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps the current code works for unique keys, and the issue is elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the example for make_sort_unique(), when keys are [2,4,3,1], the output is [1,2,3,4], which is correct. But when keys have duplicates, like [2,2,3,1], the target_pos would be [0,0,2,0]. Then sel_new would select j where target_pos[j] == i. So for i=0, j=0,1,3. So the selector would have multiple Trues, and Aggregate would average the vals at those positions. But we don't want averaging; we want to select the vals in the order of their ranks. So the current approach is incorrect for non-unique keys, which is why make_sort() was adjusted to make keys unique.\n\nBut make_sort_unique() is supposed to handle unique keys, so perhaps it's correct as is. The issue might be in make_sort_freq().\n\nSo, focusing on make_sort_freq(), the function should sort the vals based on the frequency of the keys, with ties broken by the original order. The current code computes hist as -make_hist(), then calls make_sort() with hist as keys. But in the example, when keys are [2,4,2,1], hist is [2,1,2,1], so -hist is [-2,-1,-2,-1]. The adjusted keys in make_sort() become unique, but the sort order might not preserve the original order for ties.\n\nWait, in the example, the frequencies are [2,1,2,1], so the keys after adjustment are:\n\nFor i=0: -2 - (1 * 0)/5 = -2\ni=1: -1 - (1 *1)/5 = -1.2\ni=2: -2 - (1*2)/5 = -2.4\ni=3: -1 - (1*3)/5 = -1.6\n\nSo the adjusted keys are [-2, -1.2, -2.4, -1.6]. Sorting these in ascending order gives -2.4, -2, -1.6, -1.2. The corresponding original indices are 2,0,3,1. So the output vals would be [2,2,1,4], but the expected output is [2,2,4,1]. Hmm, that's a problem. It seems that the adjustment is causing the order to be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the adjustment should be done differently. Instead of subtracting min_key * index / max_seq_len, maybe we should add a small epsilon based on the index to ensure that the keys are unique while preserving the original order for ties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjustment should be min_key + index / max_seq_len, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the goal is to make the keys unique by adding a small value based on the index so that when frequencies are the same, the token that appears first in the original sequence comes first in the sorted output.\n\nSo, for keys with the same frequency, the one with the smaller index should come first. So the adjustment should be such that for equal keys, the one with the smaller index has a smaller adjusted key.\n\nIn the current code, the adjustment is keys = keys - min_key * index / max_seq_len. So for equal keys, the one with a smaller index will have a larger adjusted key (since subtracting a smaller term). Wait, no: for example, key=2 at index 0: 2 - 1*0/5 = 2. At index 2: 2 -1*2/5=1.6. So the adjusted key at index 2 is smaller than at index 0. So when sorted in ascending order, index 2 comes before index 0, which is the opposite of what we want. Because we want the token that appears first (smaller index) to come first in the sorted output when frequencies are the same.\n\nSo the adjustment is incorrect. Instead, perhaps we should add the index term, not subtract. Or adjust the sign.\n\nWait, let's think: for two tokens with the same frequency, we want the one with the smaller index to come first in the sorted output. So their adjusted keys should be such that the one with the smaller index has a smaller adjusted key.\n\nSo, for token i and token j, if i < j and frequency[i] == frequency[j], we want adjusted_key[i] < adjusted_key[j].\n\nSo, adjusted_key = frequency + (index / max_seq_len). Because adding a smaller index would make the adjusted key smaller, so when sorted in ascending order, i comes before j.\n\nWait, but in the current code, it's keys = keys - min_key * index / max_seq_len. So for same frequency, the token with smaller index has a larger adjusted key, which would come later in the sorted order. That's the opposite of what we want.\n\nSo the adjustment should be to add the index term, not subtract. So the correct adjustment would be keys = keys + (index / max_seq_len). But since we're using min_key, perhaps it's better to scale it as min_key * index / max_seq_len.\n\nWait, let me adjust the code in make_sort() to use addition instead of subtraction.\n\nSo, in make_sort(), the keys adjustment should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nThis way, for tokens with the same x"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 8719}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
