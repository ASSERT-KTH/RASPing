This caused incorrect counting of close tokens. The corrected code now properly compares tokens using equality for both open", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. Since all are True, each row's width should be the length of the sequence. So when we evaluate, each element becomes the length. That seems correct. But maybe the problem is that the selector is a square matrix of all True, so SelectorWidth would return a sequence where each element is the length. So make_length() should work as intended. Hmm, perhaps no issue here.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It takes a boolean SOp, converts it to numerical, then creates a selector where indices are LEQ, meaning each position looks at all previous positions including itself. Then it aggregates the bools using this selector, which averages the True values up to each position. But wait, the example shows that for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]. Let's see: for each position i, it's the count of True in bools up to i, divided by i+1. But the current code uses Aggregate with default=0. However, the selector includes the current position, so for position 0, it's just the first element. But in the example, the first element is 0, which suggests that maybe the current position isn't included. Wait, the example for make_frac_prevs uses bools = tokens == 'l'. For \"hello\", the bools would be [False, False, True, False, False]. Then, for each position i, the selector is LEQ, so for i=0, it's just position 0. So the aggregate would be 0 (since False is 0). For i=1, positions 0 and 1: both False, so 0. For i=2, positions 0,1,2: one True, so 1/3. That matches the example. So the code seems correct. Maybe no issue here.\n\nLooking at make_pair_balance(). It creates bools_open as sop == open_token, then computes frac_prevs for opens. Similarly for closes, but wait, the code uses sop > close_token. That's probably a bug. It should be sop == close_token, not greater than. Because we want to count when the token is exactly the close token. Using '>' would compare the token's value, which might not be intended. So that's likely an error. Also, the function returns a LinearSequenceMap with coefficients 1 and -1, which subtracts the closes from opens. But the example shows that the output is the fraction of opens minus closes. So the code should be using == for both open and close tokens.\n\nThen, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the function computes balances for each pair. It checks if any balance is negative, which would indicate unbalanced. Then, it checks if all balances are zero at the end. But the way it's implemented might have issues. Let's see:\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is created by OR-ing all balances being less than zero. But each balance is a sequence, so comparing balance < 0 would create a boolean sequence. Then, any_negative is the OR of these. But when we aggregate, using select_all, which is all True, it averages the any_negative values. Wait, but any_negative is a boolean sequence. Converting it to numerical would turn True into 1 and False into 0. Then, Aggregate with select_all would average all 1s and 0s across the sequence. But the intention is to check if any position has a negative balance. So if any element in any_negative is True (1), then has_neg would be 1. But the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all the 1s and 0s. So if any element is 1, the average would be greater than 0. But the code then uses has_neg as a numerical value. However, the way it's used later in the return statement might not correctly capture whether any balance was negative.\n\nAlso, in the return statement, it's using (last_zero & not_has_neg). But last_zero is the aggregate of all_zero at the last position, which checks if all balances are zero at the end. However, the way it's computed might not correctly handle all cases. For example, if the last element is zero but some intermediate elements were negative, the shuffle_dyck should return 0. But the current code might not capture that correctly because has_neg is an average, not a boolean indicating whether any were negative.\n\nAnother issue is in make_pair_balance(), where the close_token comparison uses '>', which is incorrect. It should be '=='. So that's a clear bug.\n\nAdditionally, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is created by OR-ing all the balance < 0 conditions. But each balance is a sequence, so the OR operation might not correctly propagate across all elements. Instead, perhaps we should create a selector that checks if any element in any balance is negative and then aggregate that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The any_negative is supposed to be True if any balance at any position is negative. So for each position in the sequence, if any of the balances is negative, any_negative should be True. Then, has_neg is the aggregate of any_negative across all positions, which would be 1 if any position had any_negative True. But the current code uses select_all, which includes all positions, so the average would be non-zero if any position had any_negative True. However, the way it's used later in the return statement might not correctly handle this, because it's treated as a numerical value, not a boolean.\n\nMoreover, the return statement is (last_zero & not_has_neg). But last_zero is the aggregate of all_zero at the last position, which is 1 if all balances are zero at the end. However, if any balance was negative at any position, has_neg would be non-zero, so not_has_neg would be zero, making the entire expression zero. But if all balances are zero at the end and no negatives occurred, it would be 1. But the way has_neg is computed might not correctly capture whether any balance was negative at any position.\n\nWait, let's see: any_negative is a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which includes all positions, the average would be 1 if any position had any_negative True, because even one True would make the average non-zero. So has_neg would be 1 if any position had any_negative True. Then, not_has_neg is the inverse, which would be 0 if any position had any_negative True. So in the return statement, last_zero is 1 only if all balances are zero at the last position, and not_has_neg is 1 only if no position had any_negative True. So the AND of these two would be 1 only if both conditions are met: all balances are zero at the end, and no balance was negative at any position. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the way any_negative is computed might not correctly handle all cases. Because any_negative is the OR of all balances being less than zero. But each balance is a sequence, so the OR operation is element-wise. So for each position, any_negative is True if any balance is negative at that position. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which includes all positions, the average would be 1 if any position had any_negative True. So has_neg would be 1 if any position had any_negative True. So the logic seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is in the way the any_negative is converted to numerical. Let me check the code:\n\nany_negative = balances[0] < 0\nfor balance in balances[1:]:\n    any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\nThen, any_negative is converted to numerical via rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)). Wait, but any_negative is already a boolean sequence. Converting it to numerical would turn True into 1 and False into 0. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which is all True, the average would be the mean of all 1s and 0s. So if any element is 1, the average is >= 1/(sequence length). But in the return statement, we're using has_neg as a numerical value, and then not_has_neg is the inverse. But perhaps we should instead create a selector that checks if any element is True, and then use that to determine if any_negative is True.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all the 1s and 0s, but we need to check if any element is 1. So instead of averaging, we should check if the sum is greater than zero. But RASP doesn't have a sum function, only aggregate which averages. So perhaps the current approach is incorrect because it's using an average instead of a sum.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is 1 if all parentheses are balanced and 0 otherwise. So the function should return 1 only if two conditions are met: all balances are zero at the end, and no balance was negative at any position.\n\nIn the current code, has_neg is the average of any_negative across all positions. So if any position had any_negative True (1), has_neg would be >= 1/(n), which is non-zero. Then, not_has_neg is 1 - has_neg, but wait, no: not_has_neg is (~has_neg). But has_neg is a numerical SOp, so ~ would invert the boolean. Wait, no: in the code, has_neg is a numerical SOp, which is the result of Aggregate, which returns a numerical value. So ~has_neg would be the boolean NOT of has_neg, which is 1 if has_neg is 0, and 0 otherwise. But has_neg is the average of any_negative, which is 1 if any position had any_negative True. So ~has_neg would be 1 only if has_neg is 0, meaning no position had any_negative True.\n\nWait, but in the code, has_neg is computed as:\n\nselect_all = Select(indices, indices, TRUE)\nhas_neg = Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)\n\nSo any_negative is a sequence of 0s and 1s. Aggregate with select_all would compute, for each position, the average of all elements in any_negative. Wait, no: the selector is a square matrix of all True, so for each position i, it looks at all positions j, and aggregates the any_negative[j] values. So for each i, the result is the average of all any_negative[j] for j in 0..n-1. So if any any_negative[j] is 1, then the average is >= 1/n. So has_neg would be a sequence where each element is the same: the average of all any_negative values.\n\nBut in the return statement, we have:\n\nreturn (last_zero & not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\")\n\nlast_zero is the aggregate of all_zero at the last position. all_zero is the AND of all balances being zero. So last_zero is 1 only if all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nnot_has_neg is the inverse of has_neg. But has_neg is a numerical value, so ~has_neg would be 1 if has_neg is 0, else 0. So if any any_negative[j] is 1, has_neg is non-zero, so ~has_neg is 0. Thus, the entire expression is 1 only if last_zero is 1 and has_neg is 0, meaning no any_negative[j] was 1.\n\nWait, but the way has_neg is computed is as the average of all any_negative[j]. So if any any_negative[j] is 1, has_neg is non-zero, so ~has_neg is 0. Thus, the return expression is 1 only if all any_negative[j] are 0 and all balances are zero at the end.\n\nBut the problem is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all any_negative[j] values. So if any any_negative[j] is 1, has_neg is non-zero, which correctly sets ~has_neg to 0. So the logic seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the code uses 'any_negative = balances[0] < 0' and then ORs the others. But each balance is a sequence, so the OR operation is element-wise. So any_negative becomes a sequence where each element is True if any balance was negative at that position. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which includes all positions, the average is non-zero if any element in any_negative is True.\n\nWait, but the way any_negative is created is by OR-ing the balance < 0 for each balance. So for each position i, any_negative[i] is True if any balance was negative at i. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which includes all positions, the average is non-zero if any any_negative[i] is True. So has_neg is non-zero if any position had any balance negative. Thus, the logic is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is in the way the any_negative is converted to numerical. Let me see:\n\nany_negative is a boolean sequence. Then, it's passed to rasp.numerical(), which converts it to 0s and 1s. Then, when we aggregate with select_all, which is all True, the average is computed across all elements. So if any element is 1, the average is non-zero. Thus, has_neg is non-zero if any any_negative[i] is True.\n\nBut in the return statement, we have:\n\nreturn (last_zero & not_has_neg).named(\"shuffle_dyck\")\n\nlast_zero is 1 only if all balances are zero at the last position. not_has_neg is 1 only if has_neg is 0, which means no any_negative[i] is True.\n\nThus, the function returns 1 only if both conditions are met: all balances are zero at the end, and no balance was negative at any position.\n\nSo the logic seems correct. But perhaps the issue is in the way the any_negative is computed. Let me check the code again:\n\nany_negative = balances[0] < 0\nfor balance in balances[1:]:\n    any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\nThis correctly creates a boolean sequence where each element is True if any balance is negative at that position.\n\nWait, but in the code, the any_negative is created as a boolean sequence, then converted to numerical. But when we aggregate, we're using select_all, which includes all positions. So the average is non-zero if any any_negative[i] is True.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the code uses 'any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative))'. But any_negative is already a boolean sequence. Converting it to numerical would turn True into 1 and False into 0. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the make_pair_balance() function, where the close_token comparison uses '>', which is incorrect. It should be '=='. So that's a clear bug.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), the close_token comparison uses '>', which should be '=='.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the way any_negative is computed and aggregated might not correctly capture whether any balance was negative at any position. But upon closer inspection, it seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the example given in make_shuffle_dyck(). For the input \"({)}\", the output is [1,1,1,1], which suggests that the parentheses are balanced. But let's see:\n\nThe pairs are [\"()\", \"{}\"]. So for each token:\n\nIndex 0: '(' \u2192 open for \"()\", balance increases by 1.\nIndex 1: '{' \u2192 open for \"{}\", balance increases by 1.\nIndex 2: ')' \u2192 close for \"()\", balance decreases by 1 \u2192 now 0.\nIndex 3: '}' \u2192 close for \"{}\", balance decreases by 1 \u2192 now 0.\n\nSo all balances are zero at the end, and no balance was negative. So the function should return 1 for all positions.\n\nAnother example: \"(){)}\" \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,0]. Let's see:\n\nIndex 0: '(' \u2192 balance for \"()\" is 1.\nIndex 1: ')' \u2192 balance for \"()\" is 0.\nIndex 2: '(' \u2192 balance for \"()\" is 1.\nIndex 3: ')' \u2192 balance for \"()\" is 0.\nIndex 4: '}' \u2192 balance for \"{}\" is -1 (since it's a close without an open).\n\nSo at index 4, the balance for \"{}\" is -1, which is negative. Thus, any_negative would be True at index 4, making has_neg non-zero, so not_has_neg is 0. Thus, the function returns 0 for all positions.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nWait, but in the code, the any_negative is computed as the OR of all balances < 0. So for each position, if any balance is negative, any_negative is True. Then, when aggregated with select_all, has_neg is non-zero if any any_negative[i] is True.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that in make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is computed as a boolean sequence, then converted to numerical, but when aggregated, it's averaged across all positions. So if any any_negative[i] is True, has_neg is non-zero. Thus, the logic is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the any_negative is converted to numerical via rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)). But any_negative is already a boolean sequence, so this is redundant. It could be simplified to rasp.numerical(any_negative).\n\nBut that's not a bug, just unnecessary code.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the make_pair_balance() function, where the close_token comparison uses '>', which is incorrect. It should be '=='. So that's a clear bug.\n\nSo, to repair the program, I need to:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), change the comparison for close_token from '>' to '=='.\n\n2. Ensure that all other parts are correct.\n\nLet me check the other functions again.\n\nIn make_length(), the code seems correct.\n\nIn make_frac_prevs(), the code seems correct.\n\nIn make_pair_balance(), the bug is in the close_token comparison.\n\nIn make_shuffle_dyck(), the logic seems correct.\n\nThus, the main issue is in make_pair_balance() where the close_token comparison uses '>', which should be '=='.\n\nSo, the repaired code should have:\n\nbools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n\ninstead of:\n\nbools_close = rasp.numerical(sop > close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n\nThat's the primary fix needed.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop > close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] == 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
