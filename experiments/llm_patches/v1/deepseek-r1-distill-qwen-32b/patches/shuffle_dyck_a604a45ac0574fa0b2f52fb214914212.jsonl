We changed it to use equality checks.\n\n2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Balances in `make_shuffle_dyck()`**: The function incorrectly averaged boolean results to detect any negative balances. We adjusted it to correctly identify if any position has a negative balance.\n\nHere is the repaired code:\n\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bool", "refusal": null, "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to repair the given RASP program. Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. Since all are True, it should return the length. But in the example, when the input is \"abcdefg\", the output is [7.0, ..., 7.0]. That makes sense because each element is 7.0. So make_length() seems correct.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It takes a boolean SOp, converts it to numerical, then creates a selector using LEQ on indices. Then it aggregates the bools using this selector. Wait, the selector is created with LEQ, which for indices would be i <= j. So for each position j, it's selecting all i <= j. Then Aggregate averages the bools up to j. But in the example, for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]. Let's see: for each position j, it's the sum of bools up to j divided by j+1. Hmm, but the example shows for position 2 (third element), it's 1/3. That suggests that the count is 1 out of 3. So the code seems correct because it's summing up to j and dividing by j+1.\n\nWait, but in the code, after Aggregate, it's using numerical. But the Aggregate function returns an SOp where each element is the average. So that should be correct.\n\nMoving on to make_pair_balance(). It computes the fraction of previous open tokens and subtracts the fraction of close tokens. The example shows that for \"a()b(c))\", the output is [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]. Let me check the code. It creates bools_open as sop > open_token, which might be incorrect. Wait, comparing tokens with > might not be the right approach. For example, if the token is a string like \"(\", comparing using > might not work as intended. Oh, right, because in the original code, sop is compared using >, which for strings might not give the correct boolean. Instead, it should check if the token equals the open_token.\n\nWait, looking at the code: bools_open is defined as sop > open_token. That's probably wrong. It should be sop == open_token. Because we want to count when the token is exactly the open token. Similarly for close_token. So that's a bug. The same applies to bools_close, which uses sop == close_token, which is correct. So the open part is incorrect.\n\nSo in make_pair_balance(), the line bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop > open_token) should be changed to sop == open_token.\n\nThen, in make_shuffle_dyck(), it uses make_pair_balance for each pair. If the pair_balance is incorrect, then the shuffle_dyck function will also be incorrect.\n\nAnother issue: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is created by checking if any balance is negative. But the code uses balances[0] < 0 and then ORs with others. However, balances are SOps, so comparing them with < 0 is correct. But when aggregating, it uses select_all and aggregates any_negative. Wait, any_negative is already a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. Then, Aggregate with select_all would average all the 1s and 0s. But in the code, has_neg is the result of this aggregation. However, if any position has a negative balance, has_neg would be 1.0 if any element is 1, else 0. But the way it's computed, it's the average, which would be 1.0 only if all are 1. That's incorrect. We need has_neg to be 1 if any position has a negative balance.\n\nWait, no. The any_negative is a sequence where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. Then, select_all selects all elements, and Aggregate averages them. So if any element is 1, the average would be >= 1/(length). But we need has_neg to be 1 if any element is 1, else 0. So using Aggregate with select_all and default=0 is incorrect because it averages. Instead, we should check if any element is non-zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should instead use a selector that checks if any element is non-zero. Alternatively, maybe the any_negative should be converted into a boolean indicating whether any position has a negative balance.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that has_neg is computed as the average of any_negative, which is 1 if any balance is negative at any position. But the average would be non-zero if any position is 1. However, the code then uses has_neg in not_has_neg, which is the inverse. But the way it's used in the final return is (last_zero & not_has_neg). So if any_negative is non-zero, has_neg would be non-zero, making not_has_neg zero, thus the final result would be zero.\n\nWait, but the example expects 1 if all parentheses are balanced, which requires that no balance is negative and the final balance is zero. So the code's logic seems correct, but the way any_negative is computed might be wrong.\n\nWait, another issue: in make_frac_prevs(), the code uses LEQ on indices. But when j is the current position, it's selecting all i <= j. So for each j, it's considering all previous positions up to j. That's correct for cumulative counts.\n\nWait, but in make_frac_prevs(), the code is:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\nreturn rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\nSo for each j, it's aggregating all i <= j. So the count is j+1 elements (since indices start at 0). So the average is sum(bools up to j) / (j+1). That's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example, for \"hello\", the output is [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]. Let's see:\n\nIndices are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor j=0: only i=0. bools[0] is 0 (assuming 'h' is not 'l'). So 0/1=0.\n\nj=1: i=0,1. Both 0. 0/2=0.\n\nj=2: i=0,1,2. Suppose 'l' is at index 2. So sum is 1. 1/3.\n\nj=3: i=0-3. Suppose 'l' is at 2 and 3? Wait, \"hello\" is h e l l o. So indices 2 and 3 are 'l's. So at j=3, sum is 2. 2/4=0.5.\n\nj=4: sum is 2 (indices 2 and 3). 2/5=0.4.\n\nWhich matches the example. So make_frac_prevs() seems correct.\n\nBack to make_pair_balance(). The issue is that bools_open is using sop > open_token, which is incorrect. It should be sop == open_token.\n\nSo in the code, the lines:\n\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop > open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\nshould be:\nbools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n\nSimilarly, for bools_close, it's correctly using sop == close_token.\n\nAnother potential issue: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the any_negative is computed as the OR of all balances being negative. But when using Aggregate with select_all, it's taking the average. So if any position has a negative balance, any_negative at that position is 1. Then, aggregating with select_all would average all 1s and 0s across the sequence. But we need has_neg to be 1 if any position has a negative balance, else 0.\n\nWait, no. The any_negative is a sequence where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. Then, select_all selects all elements, and Aggregate averages them. So if any element is 1, the average would be >= 1/(length). But we need has_neg to be 1 if any element is 1, else 0. So the current approach is incorrect because it's using the average, which could be a fraction.\n\nInstead, we should check if any element in any_negative is non-zero. But how to do that in RASP? Perhaps, we can create a selector that checks if any element is non-zero and then use Aggregate to see if any are non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use SelectorWidth on a selector that is any_negative > 0, and then check if the width is greater than zero.\n\nWait, but any_negative is already a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. So to check if any position has a 1, we can create a selector where any_negative > 0, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than zero, then has_neg should be 1.\n\nBut in the current code, has_neg is computed as the average of any_negative, which is incorrect. So we need to adjust that.\n\nSo in make_shuffle_dyck(), the code for has_neg should be:\n\nselect_any = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, any_negative), rasp.Comparison.TRUE)\nwidth = rasp.SelectorWidth(select_any)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, width)\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that any_negative is 1 where any balance is negative. So we can create a selector that is any_negative > 0, then use SelectorWidth to count how many positions have this. If the width is greater than zero, then has_neg is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\nany_negative_selector = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, any_negative), rasp.Comparison.TRUE)\nany_negative_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative_selector)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_width)\n\nBut this might be more complicated. Alternatively, since any_negative is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position, we can create a selector that is any_negative > 0, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values. If the count is greater than zero, then has_neg is 1.\n\nWait, but in the code, has_neg is used in the final return as (last_zero & not_has_neg). So if any_negative is non-zero, has_neg is 1, and not_has_neg is 0, making the final result 0.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute has_neg as whether any element in any_negative is non-zero. So we can do:\n\nany_negative_selector = rasp.Select(any_negative, rasp.Map(lambda x: x > 0, any_negative), rasp.Comparison.TRUE)\nany_negative_exists = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative_selector)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_exists)\n\nBut this might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that any_negative is a numerical SOp and use a LinearSequenceMap to check if any element is non-zero.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the following:\n\nany_negative_exists = rasp.SelectorWidth(rasp.Select(any_negative, any_negative, rasp.Comparison.NEQ))\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_exists)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of using Aggregate with select_all is incorrect because it averages, and we need to check if any element is non-zero. So perhaps we should instead use a selector that is any_negative > 0, then use SelectorWidth to count the number of True values, and if it's greater than zero, set has_neg to 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nany_negative_selector = rasp.Select(any_negative, any_negative, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\nany_negative_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative_selector)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_width)\n\nBut wait, any_negative is already a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. So any_negative_selector would select where any_negative != 0, which is the same as any_negative > 0. Then, any_negative_width would be the count of positions where any_negative is non-zero. If this count is greater than zero, has_neg should be 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nany_negative_selector = rasp.Select(any_negative, any_negative, rasp.Comparison.NEQ)\nany_negative_width = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative_selector)\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_width)\n\nBut this might be more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial code is incorrect because it's using the average, which could be a fraction, but we need has_neg to be 1 if any position has a negative balance.\n\nSo in the original code, has_neg is computed as the average of any_negative. So if any position has a 1, the average would be >= 1/length. But we need has_neg to be 1 if any position has 1, else 0.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute has_neg as whether any_negative has any 1s.\n\nThus, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the code for has_neg should be adjusted.\n\nAnother issue: in make_shuffle_dyck(), the line:\n\nselect_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length - 1, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"select_last\")\n\nBut length is an SOp that returns the length of the sequence. So length - 1 would be an SOp that subtracts 1 from each element. But rasp.indices is a sequence of indices [0, 1, ..., n-1]. So for each j, it's checking if j == length - 1. But length is the same for all elements, so for j = length - 1, it's True, else False. So select_last is a selector where only the last position is True.\n\nThen, last_zero is the Aggregate of select_last on all_zero. So it takes the value of all_zero at the last position.\n\nBut all_zero is a sequence where each element is True if all balances are zero at that position. So last_zero is True only if all balances are zero at the last position.\n\nBut in the code, last_zero is computed as rasp.Aggregate(select_last, all_zero). Since select_last selects only the last element, the average is just the value of all_zero at the last position.\n\nSo that part seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. In make_pair_balance(), bools_open is using sop > open_token instead of sop == open_token.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the computation of has_neg is incorrect because it's using the average of any_negative, which could be a fraction, but we need it to be 1 if any position has a negative balance.\n\nSo to fix these:\n\nFor issue 1: Change sop > open_token to sop == open_token.\n\nFor issue 2: Compute has_neg as whether any position in any_negative is non-zero.\n\nSo in make_shuffle_dyck(), replace:\n\nselect_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\"select_all\")\nhas_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\"has_neg\")\n\nwith:\n\nany_negative_selector = rasp.Select(any_negative, any_negative, rasp.Comparison.NEQ).named(\"any_negative_selector\")\nany_negative_exists = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative_selector).named(\"any_negative_exists\")\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_exists).named(\"has_neg\")\n\nBut wait, any_negative is already a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance is negative at that position. So any_negative_selector would select where any_negative != 0, which is the same as any_negative > 0. Then, any_negative_exists is the count of such positions. If the count is >0, has_neg is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use:\n\nany_negative_exists = rasp.SelectorWidth(rasp.Select(any_negative, any_negative, rasp.Comparison.NEQ))\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_exists)\n\nBut in code, we need to name these steps.\n\nSo the corrected make_shuffle_dyck() function would have:\n\nany_negative_selector = rasp.Select(any_negative, any_negative, rasp.Comparison.NEQ).named(\"any_negative_selector\")\nany_negative_exists = rasp.SelectorWidth(any_negative_selector).named(\"any_negative_exists\")\nhas_neg = rasp.Map(lambda x: 1.0 if x > 0 else 0.0, any_negative_exists).named(\"has_neg\")\n\nBut wait, any_negative is a numerical SOp, so comparing it with NEQ would create a selector where each element is True if the corresponding any_negative element is non-zero. Then, SelectorWidth counts the number of True elements. If this count is greater than zero, has_neg is 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the final code would have these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop > open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] == 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
