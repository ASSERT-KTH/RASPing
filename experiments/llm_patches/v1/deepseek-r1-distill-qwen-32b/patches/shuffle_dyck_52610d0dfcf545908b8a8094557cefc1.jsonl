Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_length(). The function creates a selector where all comparisons are TRUE, then uses SelectorWidth to get the count. But wait, SelectorWidth returns the number of True values per row. Since all are True, each row's width should be the length of the sequence. That makes sense. But in the example, when the input is \"abcdefg\", the output is [7.0, ..., 7.0], which is correct. So maybe make_length() is okay.\n\nNext, make_frac_prevs(). It takes a boolean SOp, converts it to numerical, then creates a selector using LEQ on indices. Then it aggregates this selector with the boolean values. The idea is to average the previous booleans up to each position. But wait, the selector is created with LEQ, which includes the current index. So for position i, it includes i, which is the current element, not just previous. That's a problem because we want the fraction of previous tokens, not including the current one. So the selector should use LT instead of LEQ. That way, each row i includes only j < i, which are the previous elements.\n\nMoving on to make_pair_balance(). It computes the fraction of open and close tokens using make_frac_prevs(). Then it subtracts the close fraction from the open. But if the selector in make_frac_prevs() includes the current element, then the fractions are incorrect because they include the current token. So fixing make_frac_prevs() to use LT should fix this function as well.\n\nFinally, make_shuffle_dyck(). It computes balances for each pair, checks if any balance is negative, and if the final balance is zero. But the way it aggregates 'any_negative' might be incorrect. It uses Aggregate with select_all, which averages all elements. However, if any element is negative, the average could be non-zero, but we need a boolean indicating if any are negative. Instead, we should use a selector that checks if any element is True (negative) and then use Aggregate with a function that returns 1 if any are True. Alternatively, perhaps using a Map to check if any_negative is greater than zero and then using a selector to pick the maximum.\n\nWait, in the current code, any_negative is created by OR-ing the balances being less than zero. Then it's converted to numerical. When aggregated with select_all, it averages all the 1s and 0s. But if any are 1, the average is non-zero, which is correct for has_neg. But the problem is that the final output is supposed to be 1 if all parentheses are balanced and 0 otherwise. The current code uses last_zero (whether the last balance is zero) and not_has_neg (no negatives anywhere). But the way has_neg is computed might not correctly capture if any position had a negative balance.\n\nAnother issue is in the return statement: (last_zero & not_has_neg). But last_zero is an SOp, and not_has_neg is also an SOp. The & operator might not work as intended because it's a boolean operation, but we need to ensure that the result is 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nWait, looking back, in make_shuffle_dyck(), the 'any_negative' is created by OR-ing the balances being less than zero. Then, 'has_neg' is the average of any_negative across all positions. But if any position has a negative balance, any_negative at that position is 1, so the average would be greater than zero. Thus, has_neg would be non-zero if any balance was negative. Then, not_has_neg is the negation of has_neg, which would be zero if any balance was negative.\n\nBut the return statement is (last_zero & not_has_neg). However, in RASP, the & operator is for selectors, not for numerical SOps. So this might not work as intended. Instead, we should compute whether all elements in 'any_negative' are zero, meaning no negatives anywhere. Then, check if the last balance is zero. Both conditions must be true for the parentheses to be balanced.\n\nSo perhaps, instead of using Aggregate to average, we should check if the sum of any_negative is zero. If the sum is zero, then no negatives. Also, the last balance must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a selector that checks if any_negative is all zeros and the last balance is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code uses Aggregate with select_all on any_negative, which gives the average. But we need to know if any element is 1 (indicating a negative balance). So instead of averaging, we should check if the maximum is greater than zero. But RASP doesn't have a max function. Alternatively, we can sum and check if it's greater than zero.\n\nBut RASP doesn't have a sum function directly. Hmm. Maybe we can use SelectorWidth on a selector that is True where any_negative is 1. Then, if the width is greater than zero, it means there was at least one negative.\n\nWait, let's think differently. To compute 'has_neg', we can create a selector where any_negative is True, then use SelectorWidth to count how many Trues there are. If the count is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\nSo, in make_shuffle_dyck(), instead of aggregating with select_all and default 0, which averages, perhaps we should compute whether any_negative has any True values.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each pair, compute the balance.\n2. For each balance, check if it's negative anywhere. This can be done by creating a selector where balance < 0, then using SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues. If the count is >0, then has_neg is True.\n3. Also, check if the last balance is zero for all pairs.\n4. The final result is 1 only if both conditions are met: no negatives and last balance is zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Compute any_negative as the OR of (balance < 0) for all pairs.\n- Compute has_neg as whether any_negative has any True values. This can be done by creating a selector from any_negative, then using SelectorWidth, and checking if the sum is >0.\n- Compute last_zero by selecting the last element of each balance and checking if it's zero.\n- The final result is 1 if both has_neg is False and last_zero is True.\n\nBut how to implement this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current code's issue is that 'has_neg' is computed as the average of any_negative, which is 1 if any element is True. But since it's an average, it could be a fraction. Then, not_has_neg is the negation, which would be 0 if any element was True. But in the final step, (last_zero & not_has_neg) might not work as intended because it's treating numerical values as booleans.\n\nWait, in the code, 'last_zero' is created by aggregating 'all_zero' with select_last. 'all_zero' is a selector where all balances are zero. So 'last_zero' would be True only if the last element of all_zero is True, i.e., the last balance is zero.\n\nBut the way 'any_negative' is handled might not correctly capture if any position had a negative balance. Because 'any_negative' is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any balance was negative at that position. Then, aggregating with select_all averages all these 1s and 0s. If any position has 1, the average is non-zero, so 'has_neg' is non-zero. Then, 'not_has_neg' is the negation, which would be zero if any position had a negative.\n\nBut in the final step, the code returns (last_zero & not_has_neg). However, in RASP, the & operator is for selectors, not numerical SOps. So this line might not work as intended. Instead, we need to compute whether both conditions are met.\n\nPerhaps, instead of using &, we should compute a new selector that is True only when both last_zero and not_has_neg are True.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a selector that combines these two conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the final return statement is trying to combine two numerical SOps with &, which isn't the correct approach. Instead, we should create a selector that is True only if both conditions are met.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code:\n\n- Compute 'any_negative' as before.\n- Compute 'has_neg' as whether any_negative has any True values. This can be done by creating a selector where any_negative is True, then using SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues. If the count is >0, then has_neg is True.\n- Compute 'last_zero' as before.\n- The final result is a selector that is True only if both 'last_zero' is True and 'has_neg' is False.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current code uses numerical operations where it should be using selectors.\n\nLet me try to outline the correct approach:\n\n1. For each pair, compute the balance as before.\n\n2. For each balance, create a selector where balance < 0. Then, for each position, if any balance is negative, mark it as True. This can be done by OR-ing all the individual selectors.\n\n3. Compute 'has_neg' as whether any position in the combined selector is True. This can be done by using SelectorWidth on the combined selector and checking if the width is greater than zero.\n\n4. Compute 'last_zero' by checking if the last element of each balance is zero.\n\n5. The final result is 1 if both 'has_neg' is False and 'last_zero' is True.\n\nBut implementing this in RASP requires using selectors and perhaps some aggregation.\n\nWait, perhaps the main issue is in make_frac_prevs(), which uses LEQ instead of LT. Let me fix that first.\n\nIn make_frac_prevs(), the selector is created with LEQ, which includes the current index. So for position i, it includes j <= i, which includes the current element. But we want the fraction of previous elements, so j < i. So changing the comparison to LT should fix this.\n\nSo, in make_frac_prevs(), replace:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n\nwith:\n\nprevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LT)\n\nThat should fix the fraction calculation.\n\nNow, moving to make_shuffle_dyck(). The current code computes 'any_negative' as the OR of (balance < 0) for all pairs. Then, it aggregates this with select_all, which averages the 1s and 0s. If any position has 1, the average is non-zero, so 'has_neg' is non-zero. Then, 'not_has_neg' is the negation, which is zero if any position had a negative.\n\nBut the final return statement is (last_zero & not_has_neg). However, 'last_zero' is an SOp, and 'not_has_neg' is also an SOp. The & operator is for selectors, not numerical SOps. So this line is incorrect.\n\nInstead, we need to create a selector that is True only when both 'last_zero' is True and 'not_has_neg' is True.\n\nWait, but 'last_zero' is an SOp that is True only at the last position if all balances are zero. 'not_has_neg' is an SOp that is True if there were no negatives anywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute a selector that combines these two conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result should be 1 only if both conditions are met for all positions. But since the output must be the same length as the input, perhaps each position should be 1 if the overall condition is met, else 0.\n\nWait, the desired output is a sequence where each element is 1 if the entire input up to that point is balanced, else 0. Or perhaps the entire input must be balanced, and each output element reflects that.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nshuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\") returns [1,1,1,1], which suggests that each position is 1 if the entire string is balanced up to that point. But in reality, the string \"({)}\" is not balanced because the parentheses don't match properly. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps the function is supposed to return 1 only if the entire string is balanced.\n\nWait, the example says:\n\nshuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\") returns [1,1,1,1], but \"({)}\" is not balanced. So perhaps the function is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return 1 for each position if the entire string is balanced, else 0.\n\nBut regardless, the main issue is in the way 'has_neg' and 'last_zero' are combined.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Compute 'any_negative' as a selector where any balance is negative.\n- Compute 'has_neg' as whether any_negative has any True values. This can be done by using SelectorWidth on any_negative and checking if the width is greater than zero.\n- Compute 'last_zero' as whether the last balance is zero.\n- The final result is 1 only if both 'has_neg' is False and 'last_zero' is True.\n\nBut how to implement this in RASP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'has_neg' should be a boolean indicating whether any position had a negative balance. Then, the final result is 1 only if 'has_neg' is False and 'last_zero' is True.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly have a boolean; we have to represent it as an SOp.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Create a selector 'any_negative_sel' which is True where any balance is negative.\n- Compute 'has_neg' as SelectorWidth(any_negative_sel) > 0. This would be an SOp where each element is True if there was at least one negative.\n- Then, 'not_has_neg' is the negation of 'has_neg'.\n- 'last_zero' is an SOp where each element is True if the last balance is zero.\n- The final result is the element-wise AND of 'not_has_neg' and 'last_zero'.\n\nWait, but 'last_zero' is computed as the aggregate of 'all_zero' with select_last, which gives True only at the last position if all balances are zero. So, perhaps the final result should be 1 only if 'not_has_neg' is True and 'last_zero' is True.\n\nBut how to combine these two conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result is the product of 'not_has_neg' and 'last_zero', but since they are numerical, multiplying them would give 1 only if both are 1.\n\nWait, let me think about the data types.\n\n'has_neg' is computed as the average of any_negative, which is 1 if any position had a negative balance. So 'has_neg' is a numerical SOp where each element is 1 if any position had a negative, else 0.\n\nWait, no. Because any_negative is a selector, and when aggregated with select_all, it averages the 1s and 0s. So if any position is 1, the average is >= 1/(length). So 'has_neg' would be non-zero if any position had a negative.\n\nThen, 'not_has_neg' is the negation, which would be zero if any position had a negative.\n\nBut in the final step, the code returns (last_zero & not_has_neg). But 'last_zero' is an SOp where each element is True only if the last balance is zero. 'not_has_neg' is an SOp where each element is True only if there were no negatives.\n\nBut using & on two numerical SOps isn't correct. Instead, we should create a selector that combines these two conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result should be the product of 'last_zero' and 'not_has_neg', but since they are numerical, this would give 1 only if both are 1.\n\nWait, but 'last_zero' is an SOp where each element is 1 only if the last balance is zero. 'not_has_neg' is 1 only if there were no negatives. So multiplying them would give 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nBut in the example, when the input is \"({)}\", the function returns [1,1,1,1], which suggests that the function is not correctly detecting the imbalance.\n\nWait, perhaps the main issue is that the current code doesn't correctly compute whether all parentheses are balanced. It only checks if the last balance is zero and no negatives occurred. But in the case of \"({)}\", the last balance might be zero, but the parentheses are not properly nested.\n\nSo, perhaps the function needs to ensure that all parentheses are properly closed, not just that the final balance is zero and no negatives occurred.\n\nBut that's a more complex problem, and perhaps beyond the scope of the current repair. The initial task is to fix the given code based on the issues found.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. In make_frac_prevs(), the selector uses LEQ instead of LT, including the current element. This should be fixed to LT.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), the way 'has_neg' is computed might not correctly capture if any position had a negative balance. Also, the final combination of 'last_zero' and 'not_has_neg' using & is incorrect because it's applied to numerical SOps, not selectors.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Fix make_frac_prevs() to use LT.\n\n- In make_shuffle_dyck(), correctly compute 'has_neg' as whether any position had a negative balance. This can be done by creating a selector where any_negative is True, then using SelectorWidth to count the number of Trues. If the width is greater than zero, then has_neg is True.\n\n- Then, compute 'not_has_neg' as the negation of has_neg.\n\n- Finally, compute the result as the element-wise AND of 'last_zero' and 'not_has_neg'.\n\nBut in RASP, we can't directly perform element-wise AND on numerical SOps. Instead, we need to create a selector that combines these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the result as the product of 'last_zero' and 'not_has_neg', since 1 * 1 = 1, and any other combination would be 0.\n\nWait, but 'last_zero' is an SOp where each element is 1 only if the last balance is zero. 'not_has_neg' is 1 only if there were no negatives. So, multiplying them would give 1 only if both conditions are met.\n\nBut in the example, when the input is \"({)}\", the function returns [1,1,1,1], which suggests that the function is not correctly detecting the imbalance. So perhaps the function needs to be adjusted to ensure that all parentheses are properly closed, not just that the final balance is zero and no negatives occurred.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on fixing the issues in the code as per the initial analysis.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. In make_frac_prevs(), change the selector to use LT instead of LEQ.\n\n2. In make_shuffle_dyck(), compute 'has_neg' correctly by checking if any_negative has any True values.\n\n3. Adjust the final combination of conditions.\n\nLet me implement"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5053, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 9149}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef make_length() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Creates the `length` SOp using selector width primitive.\n\n    Example usage:\n      length = make_length()\n      length(\"abcdefg\")\n      >> [7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0]\n\n    Returns:\n      length: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the length of that sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_true_selector = rasp.Select(\n        rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.TRUE\n    ).named(\"all_true_selector\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(all_true_selector).named(\"length\")\n\n\nlength = make_length()\n\n\ndef make_frac_prevs(bools: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Count the fraction of previous tokens where a specific condition was True.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_frac_prevs(rasp.tokens==\"l\")\n      num_l(\"hello\")\n      >> [0, 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/5]\n\n    Args:\n      bools: SOp mapping a sequence to a sequence of booleans.\n\n    Returns:\n      frac_prevs: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous \"True\" tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools = rasp.numerical(bools)\n    prevs = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.LEQ)\n    return rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(prevs, bools, default=0)).named(\"frac_prevs\")\n\n\ndef make_pair_balance(sop: rasp.SOp, open_token: str, close_token: str) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Return fraction of previous open tokens minus the fraction of close tokens.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    If the outputs are always non-negative and end in 0, that implies the input\n    has balanced parentheses.\n\n    Example usage:\n      num_l = make_pair_balance(rasp.tokens, \"(\", \")\")\n      num_l(\"a()b(c))\")\n      >> [0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/5, 1/6, 0, -1/8]\n\n    Args:\n      sop: Input SOp.\n      open_token: Token that counts positive.\n      close_token: Token that counts negative.\n\n    Returns:\n      pair_balance: SOp mapping an input to a sequence, where every element\n        is the fraction of previous open tokens minus previous close tokens.\n    \"\"\"\n    bools_open = rasp.numerical(sop == open_token).named(\"bools_open\")\n    opens = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_open)).named(\"opens\")\n\n    bools_close = rasp.numerical(sop == close_token).named(\"bools_close\")\n    closes = rasp.numerical(make_frac_prevs(bools_close)).named(\"closes\")\n\n    pair_balance = rasp.numerical(rasp.LinearSequenceMap(opens, closes, 1, -1))\n    return pair_balance.named(\"pair_balance\")\n\n\ndef make_shuffle_dyck(pairs: List[str]) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns 1 if a set of parentheses are balanced, 0 else.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      shuffle_dyck2 = make_shuffle_dyck(pairs=[\"()\", \"{}\"])\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"({)}\")\n      >> [1, 1, 1, 1]\n      shuffle_dyck2(\"(){)}\")\n      >> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Args:\n      pairs: List of pairs of open and close tokens that each should be balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert len(pairs) >= 1\n\n    # Compute running balance of each type of parenthesis\n    balances = []\n    for pair in pairs:\n        assert len(pair) == 2\n        open_token, close_token = pair\n        balance = make_pair_balance(\n            rasp.tokens, open_token=open_token, close_token=close_token\n        ).named(f\"balance_{pair}\")\n        balances.append(balance)\n\n    # Check if balances where negative anywhere -> parentheses not balanced\n    any_negative = balances[0] < 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        any_negative = any_negative | (balance < 0)\n\n    # Convert to numerical SOp\n    any_negative = rasp.numerical(rasp.Map(lambda x: x, any_negative)).named(\n        \"any_negative\"\n    )\n\n    select_all = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.TRUE).named(\n        \"select_all\"\n    )\n    has_neg = rasp.numerical(rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)).named(\n        \"has_neg\"\n    )\n\n    # Check if all balances are 0 at the end -> closed all parentheses\n    all_zero = balances[0] != 0\n    for balance in balances[1:]:\n        all_zero = all_zero & (balance == 0)\n\n    select_last = rasp.Select(rasp.indices, length -
