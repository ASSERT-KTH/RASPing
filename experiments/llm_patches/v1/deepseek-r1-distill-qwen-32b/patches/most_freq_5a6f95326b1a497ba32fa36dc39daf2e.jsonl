Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). The function uses rasp.Select to create a selector where each token is compared to every other token using EQ. Then it uses SelectorWidth to count the number of True values in each row. That should give the frequency of each token. But wait, in the example, when the input is \"abac\", the output is [2,1,2,1]. Let me think: each token is compared to all others, so for the first 'a', it matches the third 'a', giving two occurrences. That seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the selector includes the element itself, so the count is accurate. So make_hist() might be fine.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It takes vals and keys. It creates a selector where keys are less than each other, then uses SelectorWidth to get target positions. Then it creates a new selector comparing target_pos to indices and aggregates vals with that selector. Hmm, but when keys are not unique, this might not work correctly because the same key would map to the same target position, causing overwriting. But the function is supposed to handle unique keys, so perhaps it's correct. But in the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], the sorted output is [1,2,3,4], which seems right.\n\nNow, make_sort(). It's supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them using max_seq_len and min_key. The keys are transformed using a SequenceMap that does (x // min_key) * i / max_seq_len. Wait, but i is the index from rasp.indices. So for each key x at position i, it's scaled. But I'm not sure if this correctly ensures uniqueness. Also, in the example, when keys are [2,4,1,2], the output is [1,2,2,4], which is correct. But maybe the transformation isn't handling all cases, especially when min_key isn't 1 or when max_seq_len isn't sufficient.\n\nLooking at make_sort_freq(). It calls make_hist(), negates it, then uses make_sort with hist as keys. The goal is to sort tokens by their frequency, with higher frequency first. But in the example, the output is [2,2,4,1], which is correct. However, the function signature shows it takes max_seq_len, but in the example, it's called with three arguments, which doesn't match. Oh, wait, the function definition is make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int), but in the example, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which is incorrect. So that's a problem. The function should probably take vals and keys as arguments, similar to make_sort_unique.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut in the example usage, it's called as make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5), which suggests that the function should take vals and keys, not just max_seq_len. So the function signature is wrong. It should probably be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nBut in the current code, it's only taking max_seq_len. That's a bug. So I need to fix that.\n\nAlso, in make_sort(), the keys are transformed using (x // min_key) * i / max_seq_len. Wait, but i is the index, which starts at 0. So for the first element, i=0, which would make the entire term 0, which might not be correct. Maybe it should use i+1 or adjust the formula to avoid zero.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), the hist is negated, but when passed to make_sort(), which expects keys to sort in ascending order. So negating hist would sort in descending order of frequency, which is correct. But if two tokens have the same frequency, their original order is preserved because the keys are adjusted with their indices, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nWait, but in make_sort(), the keys are transformed to include the index, so that even if two tokens have the same frequency, their keys become unique, allowing proper sorting. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the example in make_sort_freq(). The input is [2,4,2,1], and the output should be [2,2,4,1]. The frequencies are: 2 appears twice, 4 once, 1 once. So the sorted order should be [2,2,4,1], which matches the example. So the logic seems correct.\n\nBut the function signature for make_sort_freq is wrong. It should take vals and keys, not just max_seq_len. So I need to adjust that.\n\nAlso, in the original code, make_sort_freq is defined as taking max_seq_len, but in the example, it's called with three arguments. So that's a bug. I'll correct the function signature.\n\nAnother thing: in make_sort(), the keys are transformed using (x // min_key) * i / max_seq_len. But if min_key is 1, then x // 1 is x. So the key becomes x * i / max_seq_len. But i is the index, starting from 0. So for the first element, i=0, key becomes 0. For the second, i=1, key is x * 1 / max_seq_len. Wait, but max_seq_len is the maximum sequence length, so for a sequence of length 4, max_seq_len is 4. So for i=0, key is 0, which might cause issues if x is positive. Maybe the index should start from 1, or the formula should be adjusted to avoid zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be (x // min_key) + i / max_seq_len, ensuring that each key is unique because i is different for each position. That way, even if x is the same, the i component makes the keys unique.\n\nWait, in the current code, the keys are transformed as (x // min_key) * (i / max_seq_len). So for two elements with the same x, their keys would be scaled by their indices. But if max_seq_len is large enough, this could spread them out. But perhaps using addition would be better to ensure uniqueness without scaling.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct transformation is to add a small epsilon based on the index to the keys. For example, keys = x + i / max_seq_len. This way, each key is unique because the index component is unique for each position.\n\nIn the original code, the transformation is (x // min_key) * (i / max_seq_len). But if min_key is 1, it's x * (i / max_seq_len). For example, if x is 2, i is 0, max_seq_len is 5, then key becomes 0. If i is 1, key is 2 * 1/5 = 0.4. But if another x is 2 at i=2, key is 2 * 2/5=0.8. So the keys are unique, but the ordering might not be correct because the primary sort is by x, and secondary by i. Wait, no, because the keys are x scaled by i, which might not preserve the original x order. For example, x=2 at i=1 is 0.4, x=1 at i=2 is 0.4 (if min_key is 1). Wait, no, x=1 at i=2 would be 1 * 2/5=0.4, same as x=2 at i=1. So that's a problem because their keys would be the same, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nSo the current transformation might not correctly handle cases where x * i / max_seq_len results in the same value for different x and i. Thus, the keys might not be unique as intended.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to adjust the keys by adding a small value based on the index, ensuring uniqueness without affecting the primary sort order. So the transformation should be keys = x + (i / max_seq_len). This way, the primary sort is by x, and the secondary sort is by index, ensuring that even if x is the same, the keys are unique and sorted by their original positions.\n\nSo, in make_sort(), the keys transformation should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len), keys, rasp.indices)\n\nThis ensures that each key is unique because the index component is unique for each position, and the primary sort is by x.\n\nAnother issue: in make_sort_freq(), the function is supposed to sort tokens by their frequency, with higher frequency first. The current code negates the hist, which makes higher frequencies more negative, so when sorted in ascending order, they come first. That's correct.\n\nBut in the example, when frequencies are the same, the tokens should appear in the same order as in the input. The current approach, by adding the index to the keys, ensures that the original order is preserved because the index increases with position.\n\nWait, no. Because in make_sort(), the keys are transformed to x + i / max_seq_len. So for two tokens with the same frequency, their keys would be x + i1 / max_seq_len and x + i2 / max_seq_len, where i1 < i2. So when sorted in ascending order, the token with smaller i comes first, preserving the original order. That's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize the issues:\n\n1. make_sort_freq() has the wrong function signature. It should take vals and keys as arguments, not just max_seq_len.\n\n2. In make_sort(), the keys transformation might not correctly ensure uniqueness and proper sorting order. It should be adjusted to add the index component instead of multiplying.\n\nLet me correct these issues.\n\nFor make_sort_freq(), the function should be modified to accept vals and keys, similar to make_sort_unique(). So the function signature becomes:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n\nThen, inside, it computes the histogram of keys, negates it, and uses that as the new keys for sorting.\n\nWait, no. The goal is to sort the vals (tokens) based on their frequency. So the keys for sorting should be the frequencies, and the vals are the tokens themselves. So in make_sort_freq(), the keys are the frequencies, and vals are the tokens. So the function should compute the frequency of each token, then sort the tokens based on their frequency in descending order.\n\nWait, but in the current code, make_sort_freq() is using rasp.tokens as both vals and keys, which might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe function make_sort_freq() is supposed to return tokens sorted by their frequency. So the vals are the tokens, and the keys are their frequencies. So the function should compute the frequency of each token, then sort the tokens based on these frequencies in descending order.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the frequency of each token using make_hist().\n\n2. Negate the frequencies so that higher frequencies come first when sorted in ascending order.\n\n3. Sort the tokens using these negated frequencies as keys.\n\nThus, the function should take vals (tokens) and keys (tokens) to compute frequencies, but perhaps the function signature is incorrect.\n\nWait, looking back, the original code for make_sort_freq() is:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nBut this assumes that the keys are the frequencies, and vals are the tokens. So the function is correct in that sense, but the function signature is wrong because it's not taking vals and keys as arguments. Instead, it's hardcoding rasp.tokens as both vals and keys. That's a problem because if someone wants to sort a different sequence based on another's frequency, they can't.\n\nSo, to make it general, the function should accept vals and keys, compute the frequency of keys, then sort vals based on those frequencies.\n\nThus, the corrected function should be:\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    hist = -1 * make_hist(keys).named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nWait, but make_hist() currently takes no arguments and uses rasp.tokens. So that's another issue. The make_hist() function is hardcoded to use rasp.tokens, which limits its usability. It should instead take an SOp as input and compute the histogram for that sequence.\n\nSo, I need to modify make_hist() to accept an SOp as input.\n\nLet me adjust make_hist():\n\ndef make_hist(keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nBut wait, in the original make_hist(), it's using rasp.tokens. So if we change it to take keys as input, then it can compute the histogram for any sequence.\n\nSo, the function becomes:\n\ndef make_hist(keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nBut then, in make_sort_freq(), we can pass the keys to make_hist().\n\nSo, putting it all together, the corrections are:\n\n1. Modify make_hist() to accept keys as input.\n\n2. Correct the function signature of make_sort_freq() to accept vals and keys.\n\n3. In make_sort(), adjust the keys transformation to add the index component instead of multiplying.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n\nFor make_hist():\n\ndef make_hist(keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\"same_tok\")\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\nFor make_sort_freq():\n\ndef make_sort_freq(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist(keys).named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(vals, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\"sort_freq\")\n\nAnd in make_sort(), adjust the keys transformation:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len), keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, but in the original code, the lambda was (x // min_key) * (i / max_seq_len). I'm changing it to x + (i / max_seq_len). But what about min_key? The comment says it's used to ensure keys are unique. So perhaps the correct approach is to scale the index component by min_key.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the min_key is used to adjust the keys so that the index component doesn't interfere with the actual key values. For example, if min_key is the smallest possible key value, then adding i / max_seq_len (which is less than 1) ensures that the index component doesn't cause keys to overlap.\n\nSo, the transformation should be:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len) * min_key, keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nWait, no. Because min_key is the minimum key value, perhaps the index component should be scaled relative to min_key to ensure that the index doesn't affect the primary sort order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the index component should be added as a fraction of the range between min_key and max_key. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the index component should be added as a small epsilon, regardless of min_key. For example, adding i / max_seq_len, which is between 0 and 1, ensuring that the primary sort is by x, and the secondary sort is by index.\n\nSo, the transformation becomes:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len), keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nThis way, each key is unique because the index component is unique for each position, and the primary sort is by x.\n\nSo, in make_sort(), the code becomes:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len), keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, min_key was used as x // min_key. That suggests that min_key was intended to scale the keys. Perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the keys so that the index component is scaled relative to the key's magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original approach was incorrect, and the correct way is to add the index component as a fraction of the maximum possible key value. But without knowing the key's range, it's safer to add a small epsilon based on the index.\n\nThus, the corrected make_sort() function would have:\n\nkeys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n    lambda x, i: x + (i / max_seq_len), keys, rasp.indices\n)\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the lambda was (x // min_key) * (i / max_seq_len). That suggests that min_key was used to scale the x value. But if min_key is 1, then x // 1 is x, and the key becomes x * (i / max_seq_len). But this can cause issues if x is zero or negative.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to add the index component as a fraction, ensuring that the primary sort is by x, and the secondary sort is by index.\n\nThus, the final corrections are:\n\n- Modify make_hist() to accept keys as input.\n\n- Correct make_sort_freq() function signature and usage.\n\n- Adjust the keys transformation in make_sort() to add the index component.\n\nNow, let me write the corrected code.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4623, "completion_tokens": 4096, "total_tokens": 8719}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\")\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties.
