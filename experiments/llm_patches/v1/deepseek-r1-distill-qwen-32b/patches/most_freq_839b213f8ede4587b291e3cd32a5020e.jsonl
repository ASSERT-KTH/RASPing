Removing this multiplication fixes the function to return the correct frequency counts.\n\n2. **make_sort_unique()**: The selector construction was flawed. The correct approach is to create a selector where each row represents whether each key is less than the current key. Using `SelectorWidth` on this selector gives the count of smaller keys, which determines the target position for each element. The corrected code constructs the selector properly and uses it in the aggregation.\n\n3. **make_sort()**: The function correctly adjusts keys to ensure uniqueness but had issues in how it was called. The parameters are now correctly passed as keyword arguments.\n\n4. **make_sort_freq()**: The function signature was incorrect, and the parameters passed to `make_sort()` were wrong.

Let me look through each function and see where the issues might be.\n\nStarting with make_hist(). The function is supposed to return the number of times each token occurs. The current code uses rasp.Select with EQ comparison, which creates a selector where each row has True where the token matches. Then SelectorWidth counts the Trues, which gives the frequency. But wait, the code returns SelectorWidth multiplied by -1. That would invert the counts, which is wrong. So I should remove the * -1. Also, the example shows that \"abac\" returns [2,1,2,1], which matches the correct counts without inversion. So the fix is to just return SelectorWidth without the multiplication.\n\nNext, make_sort_unique(). It's supposed to sort vals based on keys. The code creates a 'smaller' selector using LT comparison. Then SelectorWidth gives the count of smaller elements for each position. The idea is to map each position to its target index in the sorted array. But the current code uses sel_new as a Select between target_pos and indices with EQ. Then Aggregate is used with vals. Wait, but target_pos is a sequence of counts, and indices are the original positions. Maybe the issue is that the selector isn't correctly mapping each element to its new position. Perhaps the Select should compare the target positions with the indices correctly. Alternatively, maybe the Aggregate isn't correctly picking the right values. Let me think about how the sorting works. For each position i in the output, we want to select the value from the input where the key is the i-th smallest. The current approach might not correctly handle this because the selector might not be properly identifying the correct elements. Maybe the problem is that the selector is not correctly constructed, leading to incorrect aggregation. Alternatively, perhaps the way target_pos is used is flawed. I might need to adjust how the selector is built to ensure that each output position correctly aggregates the appropriate input value.\n\nMoving on to make_sort(). This function is supposed to handle non-unique keys by adjusting them using max_seq_len and min_key. The code adds a small value to each key based on its index to make them unique. Then it calls make_sort_unique. But looking at the example, when keys are [2,4,3,1], after adjustment, they become unique, and sorting works. However, the adjustment might not be sufficient if max_seq_len isn't correctly set. Also, the function's parameters include max_seq_len and min_key, but in the example, min_key is set to 1. Maybe the adjustment isn't correctly ensuring uniqueness across all possible cases. Alternatively, perhaps the way the keys are adjusted could be improved for better numerical stability.\n\nFinally, make_sort_freq() uses make_sort to sort tokens by their frequency. The current code passes max_seq_len and min_key=1. But wait, the function signature shows that make_sort expects max_seq_len and min_key as keyword arguments, but in the call, it's passed as positional arguments. That's incorrect. Also, the function make_sort_freq is defined with only max_seq_len as a parameter, but in the example, it's called with three arguments, which would cause an error. So I need to adjust the parameters and how they're passed.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. make_hist() incorrectly multiplies by -1, which should be removed.\n2. make_sort_unique() might have an incorrect selector construction, leading to wrong aggregation. Perhaps the way target_pos is used with indices isn't correct. Maybe the selector should be built differently to correctly map each element to its sorted position.\n3. make_sort() might have issues with how keys are adjusted, but perhaps that's correct. However, the way it's called in make_sort_freq() is incorrect due to parameter passing.\n4. make_sort_freq() has a wrong function signature and incorrect parameter passing when calling make_sort().\n\nSo, the repairs needed are:\n\n- In make_hist(), remove the * -1.\n- In make_sort_unique(), correct the selector and aggregation logic to properly sort the values.\n- In make_sort_freq(), fix the function parameters and how make_sort() is called.\n"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4627, "completion_tokens": 1743, "total_tokens": 6370}}], "prompt": "# Introduction to Task:\nYour assignment is to repair RASP programs. \"RASP\" stands for \"Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language\". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n# Understanding RASP:\n\nRASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.\n\n## Fundamental Principles:\n\n- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.\n- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a \"max_sequence_length\" parameter.\n- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.\n\n## Technical operational Jargon:\n\nHere are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.\n\n- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of \"True\" and \"False\" values called a selector.\n- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\n- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element\n- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.\n- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of \"True\" values in each row of a selector\n\n### Function overview:\n\n#### Select:\nFunction: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.\nSyntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`\nExample: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.\n\n#### Aggregate:\nFunction: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.\nSyntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`\nExample: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.\n\n#### Map:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.\nSyntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`\nExample: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.\n\n#### SequenceMap:\nFunction: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.\nSyntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`\nExample: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.\n\n#### SelectorWidth:\nFunction: Returns the \"width\" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of \"True\"-values in each row.\nSyntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`\nExample: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`\n\n#### Tokens, Indices:\nrasp.tokens: The original input sequence.\nrasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.\n\n### Example use of above Functions:\nThis is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the \"Greater Than\" or GT comparison operator:\n\n```python\ngreater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named(\"greater_than_selector\")\n```\nIf the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:\n[False, True, True, True]\n[False, False, True, True]\n[False, False, False, True]\n[False, False, False, False]\nIf we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:\n```python\noutput = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)\n```\nWe will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:\n[3, 3.5, 4, None]\n[\n3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4\n3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4\n4, # as an average of the selected 4\nNone # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.\n]\nNote that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one \"True\" value per row is completely fine.\nIf we now call:\n```python\ncount_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:\n[3,2,1,0]\nIf we call:\n```python\nmap_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)\n```\nWe will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBut if we call:\n```python\nsequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)\n```\nWe get an output where the sequences \"count_GT_selector\" and \"output\" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.\nAt this point, \"count_GT_selector\" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]\n[\n12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\n9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9\n5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5\n0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0\n]\n\n# Rules and Constraints:\n- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.\n- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.\n\n# Source Code\nTo make you better understand the RASP language you can look at the following code. These are the most important parts of rasp.py, which defines the library of RASP. Use this as a reference to find out what kind of functions exist in RASP, which inputs they take, and what they do.\n\n```python\n\n\"\"\"RASP program objects.\n\nclass Map(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the input SOp.\n\n  Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value], Value],\n      inner: SOp,\n      simplify: bool = True,\n  ):\n    \"\"\"Initialises.\n\n    Args:\n      f: the function to apply element-wise.\n      inner: the SOp to which to apply `f`.\n      simplify: if True and if `inner` is also a Map, will combine the new map\n        and `inner` into a single Map object.\n    \"\"\"\n    super().__init__()\n    self.f = f\n    self.inner = inner\n\n    assert isinstance(self.inner, SOp)\n    assert callable(self.f) and not isinstance(self.f, RASPExpr)\n\n    if simplify and isinstance(self.inner, Map):\n      # combine the functions into just one.\n      inner_f = self.inner.f\n      self.f = lambda t: f(inner_f(t))\n      self.inner = self.inner.inner\n\n  @property\n  def children(self) -> Sequence[RASPExpr]:\n    return [self.inner]\n\n\nclass SequenceMap(SOp):\n  \"\"\"SOp that evaluates the function element-wise on the two given SOp's.\n\n  SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, length, tokens).eval([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1, 0]\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(\n      self,\n      f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value],\n      fst: SOp,\n      snd: SOp,\n  ):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    if fst == snd:\n      logging.warning(\"Creating a SequenceMap with both inputs being the same \"\n                      \"SOp is discouraged.

(E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)\n- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.\n- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.\n- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.\n- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.\n\nAlso Note:\n- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.\n- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.\n- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.\n- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`\n- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`\n\nEndeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.\n\n# Task\n\nHere is the RASP program that you need to repair:\n```python\nfrom tracr.rasp import rasp\n\n\ndef make_hist() -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of times each token occurs in the input.\n\n     (As implemented in the RASP paper.)\n\n    Example usage:\n      hist = make_hist()\n      hist(\"abac\")\n      >> [2, 1, 2, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    same_tok = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.EQ).named(\n        \"same_tok\"\n    )\n    return rasp.SelectorWidth(same_tok).named(\"hist\") * -1\n\n\ndef make_sort_unique(vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys.\n\n    Only supports unique keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    smaller = rasp.Select(keys, keys, rasp.Comparison.LT).named(\"smaller\")\n    target_pos = rasp.SelectorWidth(smaller).named(\"target_pos\")\n    sel_new = rasp.Select(target_pos, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)\n    return rasp.Aggregate(sel_new, vals).named(\"sort\")\n\n\ndef make_sort(\n    vals: rasp.SOp, keys: rasp.SOp, *, max_seq_len: int, min_key: float\n) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns vals sorted by < relation on keys, which don't need to be unique.\n\n    The implementation differs from the RASP paper, as it avoids using\n    compositions of selectors to break ties. Instead, it uses the arguments\n    max_seq_len and min_key to ensure the keys are unique.\n\n    Note that this approach only works for numerical keys.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5, 1)\n      sort([2, 4, 3, 1])\n      >> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n      sort([2, 4, 1, 2])\n      >> [1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    Args:\n      vals: Values to sort.\n      keys: Keys for sorting.\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n      min_key: Minimum key value (used to ensure keys are unique)\n\n    Returns:\n      Output SOp of sort program.\n    \"\"\"\n    keys = rasp.SequenceMap(\n        lambda x, i: x + min_key * i / max_seq_len, keys, rasp.indices\n    )\n    return make_sort_unique(vals, keys)\n\n\ndef make_sort_freq(max_seq_len: int) -> rasp.SOp:\n    \"\"\"Returns tokens sorted by the frequency they appear in the input.\n\n    Tokens the appear the same amount of times are output in the same order as in\n    the input.\n\n    Example usage:\n      sort = make_sort_freq(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, 5)\n      sort([2, 4, 2, 1])\n      >> [2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    Args:\n      max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length (used to ensure keys are unique)\n    \"\"\"\n    hist = -1 * make_hist().named(\"hist\")\n    return make_sort(rasp.tokens, hist, max_seq_len=max_seq_len, min_key=1).named(\n        \"sort_freq\"\n    )\n\n```\n\n# Output format\n\nThe output should be the repaired RASP program, provided inside a Markdown code block.", "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", "provider": "DeepInfra", "temperature": 0.0}
