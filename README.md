### Setup

1. Install RASPy (https://github.com/srush/RASPy) and Tracr (https://github.com/google-deepmind/tracr). Make sure to replace the _rasp.py_ file in RASPy with the _rasp.py_ file in this directory before installing. This mods RASPy to allow for mean aggregation as in the original RASP paper.

2. Pray it works
